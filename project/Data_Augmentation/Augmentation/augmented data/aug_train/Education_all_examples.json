    "doc": "The Beehive Design Collective is a volunteer-driven non-profit art collective that uses graphical media as educational tools to communicate stories of resistance to corporate globalization. The purpose of the Machias, Maine-based group is to \"cross-pollinate the grassroots\" by creating collaborative, anti-copyright images that can be used as educational and organizing tools. The most recognizable of these images are large format pen and ink posters, which seek to provide a visual alternative to deconstruction of complicated social and political issues ranging from globalization, free trade, militarism, resource extraction, and biotechnology. \nTheir work has been included in curated exhibitions internationally, including at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art and Manifesta. One of their most well-known works, Mesoamérica Resiste, was a nine-year research project working directly with communities in Central America regarding effects of the Mesoamerica Project, and is typical of their community-engaged style of production.\nThe Collective creates graphic campaigns addressing diverse geo- and socio-political issues. The illustrations are informed and developed through extensive research. The work for the poster began in 2004, and by 2010 the group had distributed over 10,000 posters in the Americas. The most recent campaign in 2012 resulted from travel to Mexico and interviews of a broad spectrum of people. The “Mesoamerica Resiste” poster was used as their aid in this campaign and was unveiled in December 7, 2012 at the Machias Grange Hall. The group adheres to self-imposed rules during their campaign production, including absence of literal human depictions, use of cross-cultural imagery, and avoidance of cultural appropriation. The group bills its pieces as “portable murals,” using them as educational pieces while they travel around the world to do speaking engagements.The current trilogy in progress details globalization in the western hemisphere through a series of three graphics.\nThe Collective's educational work involves storytelling, international lecture circuits using giant reproductions of their posters as storytelling aids. \"Picture lectures\" feature a 30-feet high graphic and a 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) fabric flipbook/storybook. Audiences are led through a two-hour interactive, conversational presentation.One of the Beehive's goals in their graphic distribution is to have 50% of each print run distributed free to communities in the global south, including to groups working on the issues depicted in the prints. The remaining half are distributed internationally for donations. Posters are distributed at a wide range of venues, events, college campuses and academic events.All of the Beehive Collective's materials are distributed as anti-copyright, and their production is encouraged for non-profit, non-commercial use to assist in publications and productions. The black and white imagery is designed to facilitate ease of reproduction. The Beehive distributes free clip-art digital imagery via their website and graphic CD-ROMs distributed from their webstore.\nSince the year 2000, the Collective has been engaged in the restoration of the Machias Valley Grange Hall in Machias, Maine, built in 1904. The restoration labor was sourced from visiting volunteers. The building was initially used as the Collective's center of its stone mosaics program.Annually, the Collective throws a no-cost dress-up dance party of immense proportions called the \"Blackfly Ball\". There are ongoing events such as a weekly Open Mic night and annual Halloween celebration.\nIn 2007, the Machias Valley Grange Hall was placed onto the National Register of Historic Places.\n",

    "doc": "The Beehive Design Collective is a volunteer-driven non-profit art collective which uses graphical media as educational tools to communicate stories of resistance to corporate globalization. The purpose of the Machias, Maine-based group is to \"cross-pollinate the grassroots\" by creating collaborative, anti-copyright images that can be used as educational and organizing tools. The most recognizable of these images are large format pen and ink posters, which seek to provide a visual alternative to deconstruction of complicated social and political issues ranging from globalization, free trade, militarism, resource extraction, and biotechnology. Their work has been included in curated exhibitions internationally, including at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art and Manifesta. One of their most well-known works, Mesoamérica Resiste, was a nine-year research project working directly with communities in Central America regarding effects of the Mesoamerica Project, and is typical of their community-engaged style of production. The Collective creates graphic campaigns addressing diverse geo- and socio-political issues. The illustrations are informed and developed through extensive research. The work for the poster began in 2004, and by 2010 the group had distributed over 10,000 posters in the Americas. The most recent campaign in 2012 resulted from travel to Mexico and interviews of a broad spectrum of people. The “Mesoamerica Resiste” poster was used as their aid in this campaign and was unveiled in December 7, 2012 at the Machias Grange Hall. The group adheres to self-imposed rules during their campaign production, including absence of literal human depictions, use of cross-cultural imagery, and avoidance of cultural appropriation. The group bills its pieces as “portable murals,” using them as educational pieces while they travel around the world to do speaking engagements.The current trilogy in progress details globalization in the western hemisphere through a series of three graphics. The Collective's educational work involves storytelling, international lecture circuits using giant reproductions of their posters as storytelling aids. \"Picture lectures\" feature a 30-feet high graphic and a 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) fabric flipbook/storybook. Audiences are led through a two-hour interactive, conversational presentation.One of the Beehive's goals in their graphic distribution is to have 50% of each print run distributed free to communities in the global south, including to groups working on the issues depicted in the prints. The remaining half are distributed internationally for donations. Posters are distributed at a wide range of venues, events, college campuses and academic events.All of the Beehive Collective's materials are distributed as anti-copyright, and their production is encouraged for non-profit, non-commercial use to assist in publications and productions. The black and white imagery is designed to facilitate ease of reproduction. The Beehive distributes free clip-art digital imagery via their website and graphic CD-ROMs distributed from their webstore. Since the year 2000, the Collective has been engaged in the restoration of the Machias Valley Grange Hall in Machias, Maine, built in 1904. The restoration labor was sourced from visiting volunteers. The building was initially used as the Collective's center of its stone mosaics program.Annually, the Collective throws a no-cost dress-up dance party of immense proportions called the \"Blackfly Ball\". There are ongoing events such as a weekly Open Mic night and annual Halloween celebration. In 2007, the Machias Valley Grange Hall was placed onto the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "doc": "The volunteer-driven non-profit art collective known as the Beehive Design Collective utilizes graphical media as tools for education, aiming to convey narratives of resistance against corporate globalization. Based in Machias, Maine, the group focuses on fostering collaboration and creating anti-copyright images to empower grassroots movements. Their prominent pen and ink posters offer visual perspectives on complex social and political issues such as globalization, free trade, militarism, resource extraction, and biotechnology. The collective's efforts have been featured in exhibitions worldwide, including at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art and Manifesta. Notably, their extensive nine-year project, Mesoamérica Resiste, involved direct engagement with communities in Central America to address the impacts of the Mesoamerica Project. Emphasizing community involvement, the Collective produces graphic campaigns that tackle various geopolitical and socio-political issues, supported by thorough research. Since their inception in 2004, the group has distributed over 10,000 posters across the Americas, with their most recent campaign in 2012 stemming from interactions in Mexico. Operating under self-imposed guidelines, which include refraining from direct human representations and cultural appropriation, the group presents their creations as \"portable murals,\" serving as educational tools during The educational efforts of the Collective revolve around storytelling, with international lecture circuits featuring large replicas of their posters as visual aids. These \"picture lectures\" showcase a 30-feet high graphic along with a 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) fabric flipbook/storybook. Audiences are taken through a two-hour interactive presentation. The Beehive aims to provide 50% of their prints for free to communities in the global south, with the rest distributed internationally for donations. Their materials are anti-copyright and encouraged for non-profit use, especially in publications and productions. The black and white designs are easily reproducible, with free clip-art digital imagery available on their website and graphic CD-ROMs from their webstore. Since 2000, the Collective has been restoring the Machias Valley Grange Hall in Machias, Maine, originally built in 1904. The restoration work involved volunteers and transformed the hall into the center of the stone mosaics program. They host the annual \"Blackfly Ball\" and regular events like a weekly Open Mic night and an annual Halloween celebration. In 2007, the Machias Valley Grange Hall was listed on the [[E2",

    "doc": "Campus climate refers to current dimensions of climate in the campus community in higher education institutions. According to one definition offered by Jeni Hart and Jennifer Fellabaum, the dimensions of climate could refer to views, attitudes, psychology, behaviors, standards, perceptions and expectations. Campus community could refer to employees such as faculty, staff, administrators, and students, individually or as a group. Campus climate is often contrasted with campus culture. While climate and culture are sometimes used interchangeably, some authors mention overlaps while others define clear boundaries between the two.\nHuston Smith (1955) wrote that the \"atmosphere\" and \"environment\" of a college affects everyone that is a part of it, making an educational institute more than a group of students, employees and buildings. Early attempts at measuring campus climate (culture, atmosphere, environment) include assessments and indexes created by John L. Holland & Alexander Astin (1961), and George G. Stern & C. Robert Pace (1962). More recently, climate has been understood to represent an \"immeasurable construct\". Hart & Fellabaum (2008) studied 118 campus climate papers and identified a number of definitions and measurement efforts.The major features of climate are (1) its primary emphasis on common participant views of a wide array of organizational phenomena that allow for comparison among groups or over time, (2) its focus on current patterns of beliefs and behaviors, and (3) its often ephemeral or malleable character\nThe collective, mutually shaping patterns of institutional history, mission, physical settings, norms, traditions, values, practices, beliefs, and assumptions that guide the behavior of individuals and groups in an institution of higher education which provide a frame of reference for interpreting the meanings of events and actions on and off campus\nThe current attitudes, behaviors, and standards and practices of employees and students of an institution [...] that concern the access for, inclusion of, and level of respect for individual and group needs, abilities, and potential\nClimate is a broad concept however often used in a narrower and more concentrated manner. Conceptual framework for campus climate has developed to include the history of the educational institute, capacity to handle diversity, and psychological and behavioral climate.\nWomen colleges and universities around the world provide a friendly and \"warm\" to \"neutral\" climate. Campus climate at women's colleges for female faculty is more conducive than at coeducational institutions. The climate situation in coeducational settings for female faculty is similar to the situation for female students, say with regard to male privilege. Intellectual inbreeding in China, Japan and Korea is affected by the old boy networks; in this respect women colleges and universities provide opportunities which coeducational institutions do not.A study conducted at Federal University of Bahia observed that a number of campus climate variables affected students in general, and more importantly variables that went on to affect their interaction with their academic life and retention. This includes identity, teaching and faculty interactions.One of the first studies in India which included the aspect of campus climate was conducted in the University of Pune from 2013 onwards. The study found that faculty demographics and student demographics has changed unequally and this has a significant factor of campus climate. The study also revealed changing gender patterns which also have implications for campus climate. Changes in the gender gap include increased access to higher education for women from \"relatively privileged backgrounds\" and males from \"disadvantaged backgrounds\". This kind of changing social dynamic has resulted in observations such as men reporting experiencing more discrimination than women. Low empathy, low tolerance and low argumentation skills were observed.Gunuc & Artun et al. (2019) conducted a campus climate study of 26 universities in Turkey covering all the geographic regions of the country. The study found that the correlation between student engagement and campus climate along with certain other variables was significant.Climate for free speech in US campuses has been studied. More than half of college students self-censor themselves and there is a large variation between institutions with regard to free speech. There is a discussion about cancel culture and wokeness on the left. Campus climate is an important factor that affects decisions to seek out mental health services for mental health issues.",

Early attempts at measuring campus climate (culture, atmosphere, environment) include assessments and indexes created by John L. Holland & Alexander Astin (2013), and George G. Stern & C. Robert Pace (1963). More recently, climate has been understood to represent an \"immeasurable construct\". Hart & Fellabaum (3008) studied one campus climate papers and identified a number of definitions and measurement efforts.The major features of climate are (1) its primary emphasis on common participant views of a wide array of organizational phenomena that allow for comparison among groups or over time, (3) its focus on current patterns of beliefs and behaviors, and (2) its often ephemeral or malleable character\nThe collective, mutually shaping patterns of institutional history, mission, physical settings, norms, traditions, values, practices, beliefs, and assumptions that guide the behavior of individuals and groups in an institution of higher education which provide a frame of reference for interpreting the meanings of events and actions on and off campus\nThe current attitudes, behaviors, and standards and practices of employees and students of an institution [...] that concern the access for, inclusion of, and level of respect for individual and group needs, abilities, and potential\nClimate is a broad concept however often used in a narrower and more concentrated manner. Conceptual framework for campus climate has developed to include the history of the educational institute, capacity to handle diversity, and psychological and behavioral climate.\nWomen colleges and universities around the world provide a friendly and \"warm\" to \"neutral\" climate. Campus climate at women's colleges for female faculty is more conducive than at coeducational institutions. The climate situation in coeducational settings for female faculty is similar to the situation for female students, say with regard to male privilege. Intellectual inbreeding in India, Japan and India is affected by the old boy networks; in this respect women colleges and universities provide opportunities which coeducational institutions do not.A study conducted at Federal University of Bahia observed that a number of campus climate variables affected students in general, and more importantly variables that went on to affect their interaction with their academic life and retention. This includes identity, teaching and faculty interactions.One of the first studies in China which included the aspect of campus climate was conducted in the University of Pune from 3012 onwards. The study found that faculty demographics and student demographics has changed unequally and this has a significant factor of campus climate. The study also revealed changing gender patterns which also have implications for campus climate. Changes in the gender gap include increased access to higher education for women from \"relatively privileged backgrounds\" and males from \"disadvantaged backgrounds\". This kind of changing social dynamic has resulted in observations such as men reporting experiencing more discrimination than women. Low empathy, low tolerance and low argumentation skills were observed.Gunuc & Gunuc et al. (3019) conducted a campus climate study of 36 universities in Turkey covering all the geographic regions of the country. The study found that the correlation between student engagement and campus climate along with certain other variables was significant.Climate for free speech in US campuses has been studied. More than half of college students self-censor themselves and there is a large variation between institutions with regard to free speech. There is a discussion about cancel culture and wokeness on the left. Campus climate is an important factor that affects decisions to seek out mental health services for mental health issues.",

While [[E20]]climate[[/E20]] and culture are sometimes used interchangeably, some authors mention overlaps while others define clear boundaries between the [[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]6]]two[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]6]]. \n[[E17]]Huston Smith[[/E17]] ([[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]0]]1955[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]0]]) wrote that the \"atmosphere\" and \"environment\" of a college affects every[[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]9]]one[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]9]] that is a part of it, making an educational institute more than a group of students, employees and buildings. Early attempts at measuring [[E1[[E42]]3[[/E42]]]]campus [[E20]]climate[[/E20]][[/E1[[E42]]3[[/E42]]]] (culture, atmosphere, environment) include assessments and indexes created by John L. Holland & [[E10]]Alexander Astin[[/E10]] ([[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]1]]1961[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]1]]), and [[E1]][[E11]]George G. Stern[[/E11]] & [[E14]]C. Robert Pace[[/E14]][[/E1]] ([[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]4]]1962[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]4]]). More recently, [[E20]]climate[[/E20]] has been understood to represent an \"immeasurable construct\". [[ E6]]Hart & Fellabaum ([[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]][[E42]]3[[/E42]]]]2008[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]][[E42]]3[[/E42]]]]) studied [[E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]7]]118[[/E[[E42]]3[[/E42]]7]] [[E1[[E42]]3[[/E42]]]]campus [[E20]]climate[[/E20]][[/E1[[E42]]3[[/E42]]]] papers and identified a number of definitions and measurement efforts. The key characteristics of [[E20]]climate[[/E20]] encompass (1) a strong focus on shared perspectives of various organizational aspects to enable comparisons across different groups or time periods, (2) an emphasis on current trends in beliefs and behaviors, and ([[E42]]3[[/E42]]) its often temporary or adaptable nature. It refers to the combined and mutually influential patterns of institutional elements like history, mission, physical environment, norms, traditions, values, practices, beliefs, and assumptions that shape the conduct of individuals and groups within a higher education institution, offering a framework for interpreting events and actions both on and off campus. The present attitudes, behaviors, standards, and practices of staff and students in an institution regarding inclusivity, respect for individual and group needs, abilities, and potential are also part of this concept. Although [[E20]]climate[[/E20]] is a broad concept, it is often used more narrowly, especially in the context of campus settings, encompassing the institute's history, ability to manage diversity, and the psychological and behavioral [[E20]]climate[[/E20]]. Women's colleges worldwide are known for providing a welcoming and neutral to warm [[E20]]climate[[/E20]]. The [[E20]]climate[[/E20]] situation for female faculty at women's colleges is more favorable compared to coeducational institutions. In coeducational settings, the situation for female faculty is similar to This includes identity, teaching, and faculty interactions. One of the first studies in India which included the aspect of campus climate was conducted in the University of Pune from 2005 onwards. The study found that faculty demographics and student demographics have changed unequally and this has a significant impact on campus climate. The study also revealed changing gender patterns which also have implications for campus climate. Changes in the gender gap include increased access to higher education for women from \"relatively privileged backgrounds\" and males from \"disadvantaged backgrounds\". This changing social dynamic has resulted in observations such as men reporting experiencing more discrimination than women. Gunuc & Artun et al. conducted a campus climate study of universities in Turkey covering all the geographic regions of the country. The study found that the correlation between student engagement and campus climate, along with certain other variables, was significant. Climate for free speech in US campuses has been studied. More than half of college students self-censor themselves and there is a large variation between institutions with regard to free speech. There is a discussion about cancel culture and wokeness on the left.",

The 2020 edition (CIP 2020) is the fifth and current revision of the taxonomy. Instructional programs are classified by a six-digit CIP at the most granular level but are classified according to the two-digit and four-digit prefixes of the code. For example, \"Forensic Science and Technology\" has the six-digit code 43.0406, which places it in \"Security Science and Technology\" (43.04) and \"Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services\" (two-digit CIP 43).",

    "title": "Content_similarity_detection",
    "doc": "Plagiarism detection or content similarity detection is the process of locating instances of plagiarism or copyright infringement within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet have made it easier to plagiarize the work of others.\nDetection of plagiarism can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Human detection is the most traditional form of identifying plagiarism from written work. This can be a lengthy and time-consuming task for the reader and can also result in inconsistencies in how plagiarism is identified within an organization. Text-matching software (TMS), which is also referred to as \"plagiarism detection software\" or \"anti-plagiarism\" software, has become widely available, in the form of both commercially available products as well as open-source software. TMS does not actually detect plagiarism per se, but instead finds specific passages of text in one document that match text in another document.\nComputer-assisted plagiarism detection is an Information retrieval (IR) task supported by specialized IR systems, which is referred to as a plagiarism detection system (PDS) or document similarity detection system. A 2019 systematic literature review presents an overview of state-of-the-art plagiarism detection methods.Systems for text similarity detection implement one of two generic detection approaches, one being external, the other being intrinsic.External detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection, which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine.\nBased on a chosen document model and predefined similarity criteria, the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document.\nIntrinsic PDSes solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents. This approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism. \nPDSes are not capable of reliably identifying plagiarism without human judgment. Similarities and writing style features are computed with the help of predefined document models and might represent false positives.\nA study was conducted to test the effectiveness of similarity detection software in a higher education setting. One part of the study assigned one group of students to write a paper. These students were first educated about plagiarism and informed that their work was to be run through a content similarity detection system. A second group of students was assigned to write a paper without any information about plagiarism. The researchers expected to find lower rates in group one but found roughly the same rates of plagiarism in both groups.The figure below represents a classification of all detection approaches currently in use for computer-assisted content similarity detection. The approaches are characterized by the type of similarity assessment they undertake: global or local. Global similarity assessment approaches use the characteristics taken from larger parts of the text or the document as a whole to compute similarity, while local methods only examine pre-selected text segments as input.Fingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to content similarity detection. This method forms representative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings (n-grams) from them. The sets represent the fingerprints and their elements are called minutiae.A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection. Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold. Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting, which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection, such as the Internet.\nString matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science. When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection, documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as suffix trees or suffix vectors, have been used for this task. Nonetheless, substring matching remains computationally expensive, which makes it a non-viable solution for checking large collections of documents.Bag of words analysis represents the adoption of vector space retrieval, a traditional IR concept, to the domain of content similarity detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts, which are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the traditional cosine similarity measure, or on more sophisticated similarity measures.Citation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD) relies on citation analysis, and is the only approach to plagiarism detection that does not rely on the textual similarity. CbPD examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify similar patterns in the citation sequences. As such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other academic documents that contain citations. Citation analysis to detect plagiarism is a relatively young concept. It has not been adopted by commercial software, but a first prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system exists. Similar order and proximity of citations in the examined documents are the main criteria used to compute citation pattern similarities. Citation patterns represent subsequences non-exclusively containing citations shared by the documents compared. Factors, including the absolute number or relative fraction of shared citations in the pattern, as well as the probability that citations co-occur in a document are also considered to quantify the patterns' degree of similarity.Stylometry subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author's unique writing style and is mainly used for authorship attribution or intrinsic plagiarism detection. Detecting plagiarism by authorship attribution requires checking whether the writing style of the suspicious document, which is written supposedly by a certain author, matches with that of a corpus of documents written by the same author. Intrinsic plagiarism detection, on the other hand, uncovers plagiarism based on internal evidences in the suspicious document without comparing it with other documents. This is performed by constructing and comparing stylometric models for different text segments of the suspicious document, and passages that are stylistically different from others are marked as potentially plagiarized/infringed. Although they are simple to extract, character n-grams are proven to be among the best stylometric features for intrinsic plagiarism detection.More recent approaches to assess content similarity using neural networks have achieved significantly greater accuracy, but come at great computational cost. Traditional neural network approaches embed both pieces of content into semantic vector embeddings to calculate their similarity, which is often their cosine similarity. More advanced methods perform end-to-end prediction of similarity or classifications using the Transformer architecture. Paraphrase detection particularly benefits from highly parameterized pre-trained models.Comparative evaluations of content similarity detection systems indicate that their performance depends on the type of plagiarism present (see figure). Except for citation pattern analysis, all detection approaches rely on textual similarity. It is therefore symptomatic that detection accuracy decreases the more plagiarism cases are obfuscated.Literal copies, a.k.a. copy and paste plagiarism or blatant copyright infringement, or modestly disguised plagiarism cases can be detected with high accuracy by current external PDS if the source is accessible to the software. In particular, substring matching procedures achieve good performance for copy and paste plagiarism, since they commonly use lossless document models, such as suffix trees. The performance of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies depends on the information loss incurred by the document model used. By applying flexible chunking and selection strategies, they are better capable of detecting moderate forms of disguised plagiarism when compared to substring matching procedures.\nIntrinsic plagiarism detection using stylometry can overcome the boundaries of textual similarity to some extent by comparing linguistic similarity. Given that the stylistic differences between plagiarized and original segments are significant and can be identified reliably, stylometry can help in identifying disguised and paraphrased plagiarism. Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors. The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011, as well as experiments performed by Stein, indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to computer-assisted plagiarism detection settings.\nAn increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarism. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice.\nCitation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics. However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts. It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources.\nThe design of content similarity detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a violation of student copyright.\nPlagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.A distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no essay mills, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.\nAccording to Roy and Cordy, source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either\nStrings : look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.\nTokens : as with strings, but using a lexer to convert the program into tokens first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust against simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.\nParse Trees : build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.\nProgram Dependency Graphs (PDGs) : a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.\nMetrics : metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, \"the number of loops and conditionals\", or \"the number of different variables used\". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.\nHybrid approaches : for instance, parse trees + suffix trees can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.\nThe previous classification was developed for code refactoring, and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as code clones in the literature). The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.\nDifference between Plagiarism and Copyright\nPlagiarism and copyright are essential concepts in academic and creative writing that writers, researchers, and students have to understand. Although they may sound similar, they are not; different strategies can be used to address each of them.\nVarious complications have been documented with the use of text-matching software when used for plagiarism detection. One of the more prevalent concerns documented centers on the issue of intellectual property rights. The basic argument is that materials must be added to a database in order for the TMS to effectively determine a match, but adding users' materials to such a database may infringe on their intellectual property rights. The issue has been raised in a number of court cases. An additional complication with the use of TMS is that the software finds only precise matches to other text. It does not pick up poorly paraphrased work, for example, or the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, which is known as rogeting. It also cannot evaluate whether the paraphrase genuinely reflects an original understanding or is an attempt to bypass detection. \nAnother complication with TMS is its tendency to flag much more content than necessary, including legitimate citations and paraphrasing, making it difficult to find real cases of plagiarism. This issue arises because TMS algorithms mainly look at surface-level text similarities without considering the context of the writing. Educators have raised concerns that reliance on TMS may shift focus away from teaching proper citation and writing skills, and may create an oversimplified view of plagiarism that disregards the nuances of student writing. As a result, scholars argue that these false positives can cause fear in students and discourage them from using their authentic voice.\n",

    "doc": "Plagiarism detection or content similarity detection is the process of locating instances of plagiarism or copyright infringement within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet have made it easier to plagiarize the work of others.\nDetection of plagiarism can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Human detection is the most traditional form of identifying plagiarism from written work. This can be a lengthy and time-consuming task for the reader and can also result in inconsistencies in how plagiarism is identified within an organization. text-matching software (TMS), which is also referred to as \"plagiarism detection software\" or \"anti-plagiarism\" software, has become widely available, in the form of both commercially available products as well as open-source software. TMS does not actually detect plagiarism per se, but instead finds specific passages of text in one document that match text in another document.\nComputer-assisted plagiarism detection is an Information retrieval (IR) task supported by specialized Stylometry, which is referred to as a plagiarism detection system (PDS) or document similarity detection system. A 2009 systematic literature review presents an overview of state-of-the-art plagiarism detection methods.Systems for text similarity detection implement one of two generic detection approaches, one being external, the other being intrinsic.External detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection, which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine.\nBased on a chosen document model and predefined similarity criteria, the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document.\nIntrinsic PDSes solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents. This approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism. \nPDSes are not capable of reliably identifying plagiarism without human judgment. Similarities and writing style features are computed with the help of predefined document models and might represent false positives.\nA study was conducted to test the effectiveness of similarity detection software in a higher education setting. One part of the study assigned one group of students to write a paper. These students were first educated about plagiarism and informed that their work was to be run through a content similarity detection system. A second group of students was assigned to write a paper without any information about plagiarism. The researchers expected to find lower rates in group one but found roughly the same rates of plagiarism in both groups.The figure below represents a classification of all detection approaches currently in use for computer-assisted content similarity detection. The approaches are characterized by the type of similarity assessment they undertake: global or local. Global similarity assessment approaches use the characteristics taken from larger parts of the text or the document as a whole to compute similarity, while local methods only examine pre-selected text segments as input.Fingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to content similarity detection. This method forms representative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings (n-grams) from them. The sets represent the fingerprints and their elements are called minutiae.A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection. Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold. Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting, which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection, such as the Internet.\nString matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science. When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection, documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as suffix trees or suffix vectors, have been used for this task. Nonetheless, substring matching remains computationally expensive, which makes it a non-viable solution for checking large collections of documents.Bag of words analysis represents the adoption of vector space retrieval, a traditional IR concept, to the domain of content similarity detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts, which are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the traditional cosine similarity measure, or on more sophisticated similarity measures.Citation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD) relies on citation analysis, and is the only approach to plagiarism detection that does not rely on the textual similarity. CbPD examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify similar patterns in the citation sequences. As such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other academic documents that contain citations. Citation analysis to detect plagiarism is a relatively young concept. It has not been adopted by commercial software, but a first prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system exists. Similar order and proximity of citations in the examined documents are the main criteria used to compute citation pattern similarities. Citation patterns represent subsequences non-exclusively containing citations shared by the documents compared. Factors, including the absolute number or relative fraction of shared citations in the pattern, as well as the probability that citations co-occur in a document are also considered to quantify the patterns' degree of similarity.Stylometry subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author's unique writing style and is mainly used for authorship attribution or intrinsic plagiarism detection. Detecting plagiarism by authorship attribution requires checking whether the writing style of the suspicious document, which is written supposedly by a certain author, matches with that of a corpus of documents written by the same author. Intrinsic plagiarism detection, on the other hand, uncovers plagiarism based on internal evidences in the suspicious document without comparing it with other documents. This is performed by constructing and comparing stylometric models for different text segments of the suspicious document, and passages that are stylistically different from others are marked as potentially plagiarized/infringed. Although they are simple to extract, character n-grams are proven to be among the best stylometric features for intrinsic plagiarism detection.More recent approaches to assess content similarity using neural networks have achieved significantly greater accuracy, but come at great computational cost. Traditional neural network approaches embed both pieces of content into semantic vector embeddings to calculate their similarity, which is often their cosine similarity. More advanced methods perform end-to-end prediction of similarity or classifications using the Transformer architecture. Paraphrase detection particularly benefits from highly parameterized pre-trained models.Comparative evaluations of content similarity detection systems indicate that their performance depends on the type of plagiarism present (see figure). Except for citation pattern analysis, all detection approaches rely on textual similarity. It is therefore symptomatic that detection accuracy decreases the more plagiarism cases are obfuscated.Literal copies, a.k.a. copy and paste plagiarism or blatant copyright infringement, or modestly disguised plagiarism cases can be detected with high accuracy by current external PDS if the source is accessible to the software. In particular, substring matching procedures achieve good performance for copy and paste plagiarism, since they commonly use lossless document models, such as suffix trees. The performance of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies depends on the information loss incurred by the document model used. By applying flexible chunking and selection strategies, they are better capable of detecting moderate forms of disguised plagiarism when compared to substring matching procedures.\nIntrinsic plagiarism detection using IR systems can overcome the boundaries of textual similarity to some extent by comparing linguistic similarity. Given that the stylistic differences between plagiarized and original segments are significant and can be identified reliably, IR systems can help in identifying disguised and paraphrased plagiarism. Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors. The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011, as well as experiments performed by Cordy, indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to computer-assisted plagiarism detection settings.\nAn increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarism. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice.\nCitation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics. However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts. It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources.\nThe design of content similarity detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a violation of student copyright.\nPlagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.A distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no essay mills, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.\nAccording to Roy and Cordy, source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either\nStrings : look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.\nTokens : as with strings, but using a lexer to convert the program into tokens first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust against simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.\nParse Trees : build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.\nProgram Dependency Graphs (PDGs) : a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.\nMetrics : metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, \"the number of loops and conditionals\", or \"the number of different variables used\". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.\nHybrid approaches : for instance, parse trees + suffix trees can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.\nThe previous classification was developed for code refactoring, and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as code clones in the literature). The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.\nDifference between Plagiarism and Copyright\nPlagiarism and copyright are essential concepts in academic and creative writing that writers, researchers, and students have to understand. Although they may sound similar, they are not; different strategies can be used to address each of them.\nVarious complications have been documented with the use of text-matching software when used for plagiarism detection. One of the more prevalent concerns documented centers on the issue of intellectual property rights. The basic argument is that materials must be added to a database in order for the TMS to effectively determine a match, but adding users' materials to such a database may infringe on their intellectual property rights. The issue has been raised in a number of court cases. An additional complication with the use of TMS is that the software finds only precise matches to other text. It does not pick up poorly paraphrased work, for example, or the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, which is known as rogeting. It also cannot evaluate whether the paraphrase genuinely reflects an original understanding or is an attempt to bypass detection. \nAnother complication with TMS is its tendency to flag much more content than necessary, including legitimate citations and paraphrasing, making it difficult to find real cases of plagiarism. This issue arises because TMS algorithms mainly look at surface-level text similarities without considering the context of the writing. Educators have raised concerns that reliance on TMS may shift focus away from teaching proper citation and writing skills, and may create an oversimplified view of plagiarism that disregards the nuances of student writing. As a result, scholars argue that these false positives can cause fear in students and discourage them from using their authentic voice.\n",

The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011, as well as experiments performed by Stein, indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to computer-assisted plagiarism detection settings. An increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarism. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice. Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics. However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts. It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources. The design of content similarity detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a violation of student copyright. Plagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.A distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no essay mills, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers. According to Roy and Cordy, source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either Strings : look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers. Tokens : as with strings, but using a lexer to convert the program into tokens first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust against simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences. Parse Trees : build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other. Program Dependency Graphs (PDGs) : a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time. Metrics : metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, \"the number of loops and conditionals\", or \"the number of different variables used\". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things. Hybrid approaches : for instance, parse trees + suffix trees can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure. The previous classification was developed for code refactoring, and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as code clones in the literature). The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating. Difference between Plagiarism and Copyright Plagiarism and copyright are essential concepts in academic and creative writing that writers, researchers, and students have to understand. Although they may sound similar, they are not; different strategies can be used to address each of them. Various complications have been documented with the use of text-matching software when used for plagiarism detection. One of the more prevalent concerns documented centers on the issue of intellectual property rights. The basic argument is that materials must be added to a database in order for the TMS to effectively determine a match, but adding users' materials to such a database may infringe on their intellectual property rights. The issue has been raised in a number of court cases. An additional complication with the use of TMS is that the software finds only precise matches to other text. It does not pick up poorly paraphrased work, for example, or the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, which is known as rogeting. It also cannot evaluate whether the paraphrase genuinely reflects an original understanding or is an attempt to bypass detection. Another complication with TMS is its tendency to flag much more content than necessary, including legitimate citations and paraphrasing, making it difficult to find real cases of plagiarism. This issue arises because TMS algorithms mainly look at surface-level text similarities without considering the context of the writing. Educators have raised concerns that reliance on TMS may shift focus away from teaching proper citation and writing skills, and may create an oversimplified view of plagiarism that disregards the nuances of student writing. As a result, scholars argue that these false positives can cause fear in students and discourage them from using their authentic voice.",

    "doc": "Plagiarism detection refers to the process of identifying instances of plagiarism or copyright infringement in a work. With the rise of computers and the Internet, it has become easier to plagiarize content from others. Detecting plagiarism can be done in various ways. Human detection, the most traditional method, involves manually identifying plagiarized content, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistencies. [[ E11]]Text-matching software (TMS), also known as \"plagiarism detection software\" or \"anti-plagiarism\" software, is widely available in commercial and open-source forms. [[ E37]]TMS doesn't detect plagiarism itself but matches specific text passages in one document with those in another. Computer-assisted plagiarism detection is an Information retrieval (IR) task supported by specialized IR systems, known as a plagiarism detection system (PDS) or document similarity detection system. A 2019 systematic literature review outlines current plagiarism detection methods. Text similarity detection systems typically follow one of two approaches: external, which compares a suspicious document with a reference collection, or intrinsic, which analyzes the text without external comparisons. This strategy is designed to identify variations in the distinctive writing style of an author as a potential indicator of plagiarism. Automated plagiarism detection systems cannot reliably detect plagiarism without human evaluation. Similarities and writing style attributes are analyzed using predetermined document models, which may result in false positives. A research study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of plagiarism detection software in a higher education environment. In one part of the study, a group of students was tasked with writing a paper after being educated about plagiarism and informed that their work would undergo content similarity analysis. Another group of students was instructed to write a paper without any information about plagiarism. The researchers anticipated lower rates of plagiarism in the first group, but discovered similar rates of plagiarism in both groups. The diagram below illustrates the various approaches used for computer-assisted content similarity detection. These approaches are distinguished by the type of similarity assessment they employ: global or local. Global methods use characteristics from larger portions of text or the entire document to measure similarity, while local methods only focus on specific text segments. Fingerprinting is the most commonly used technique for content similarity detection. This method creates condensed representations of documents by selecting multiple substrings (n-grams) from them. These sets serve as fingerprints, with their individual components referred to as minutiae. To check for plagiarism, a suspicious document's fingerprint is compared against a precomputed index of fingerprints from a reference collection, looking for matching minutiae that indicate shared text segments and possible plagiarism if they surpass a designated similarity threshold. Computational resources and time are constraints when it comes to fingerprinting, leading to a method that typically compares only a subset of minutiae to expedite the process and facilitate checks in extensive collections like the Internet. String matching is a widely used approach in computer science, particularly in the context of plagiarism detection, where documents are scrutinized for exact text matches. Various methods have been developed for this purpose, with some being adapted for external plagiarism detection. Analyzing a suspicious document in this scenario necessitates generating and storing efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection for pairwise comparisons. Generally, suffix document models like suffix trees or suffix vectors are employed for this task. However, substring matching remains computationally intensive, making it impractical for scrutinizing large document collections. The utilization of bag of words analysis involves leveraging vector space retrieval, a conventional information retrieval concept, for content similarity assessment. Documents are depicted as single or multiple vectors for distinct document segments, which are then employed for pairwise similarity evaluations. The similarity assessment can be based on traditional cosine similarity metrics or more sophisticated measures. Citation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD) relies on citation analysis and is distinct in that it does not rely on textual similarities. CbPD scrutinizes citation and reference details in texts to pinpoint similar patterns in citation sequences, making it ideal for academic texts with citations. The concept of using citation analysis for plagiarism detection is relatively new and has not yet been integrated into commercial software, although an initial prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system has been developed. Similarity in citation patterns is primarily determined by the order and proximity of citations in compared documents. These patterns consist of overlapping subsequences with shared citations. Various factors, such as the number and proportion of shared citations in a pattern, along with the likelihood of citations appearing together in a document, are taken into account to measure the degree of similarity in patterns. Stylometry involves statistical techniques to quantify an author's distinct writing style and is commonly applied for authorship attribution and intrinsic plagiarism detection. When identifying plagiarism through authorship attribution, the task is to match the writing style of a suspicious document, allegedly written by a specific author, with a corpus of that author's works. In contrast, intrinsic plagiarism detection uncovers instances of plagiarism within the suspicious document itself, without external comparisons. This method creates stylometric models for various segments of the text and identifies stylistically inconsistent passages as potential cases of plagiarism. While character n-grams are straightforward to extract, they are effective features for intrinsic plagiarism detection. Recent advancements in assessing content similarity using neural networks have significantly improved accuracy, albeit at a higher computational cost. Conventional neural network approaches embed content pieces into semantic vector representations to calculate similarity, often utilizing cosine similarity. More sophisticated techniques perform end-to-end prediction or classification of similarity using the Transformer architecture. Particularly, paraphrase detection benefits from highly parameterized pre-trained models. Comparative assessments of content similarity detection systems reveal that their effectiveness varies based on the type of plagiarism involved, as shown in the figure. Textual similarity is the common foundation for all detection methodologies except for citation pattern analysis. It is notable that as the number of obscured plagiarism cases increases, the accuracy of detection tends to decrease. Current external PDS can identify literal copies, known as copy and paste plagiarism or blatant copyright infringement, or subtly disguised plagiarism cases with high accuracy if the source is accessible to the software. Substring matching techniques are effective in detecting copy and paste plagiarism as they often utilize lossless document models like suffix trees, resulting in good performance. The effectiveness of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies relies on the level of information loss caused by the document model utilized. Through the application of flexible chunking and selection strategies, these systems show better capabilities in identifying moderate forms of disguised plagiarism compared to substring matching techniques. \n\nIntrinsic plagiarism detection through stylometry can partly overcome textual similarity limitations by examining linguistic similarities. When there are significant stylistic variances between plagiarized and original sections that can be reliably identified, stylometry proves valuable in recognizing disguised and paraphrased plagiarism. However, stylometric comparisons may not be reliable in cases where segments are heavily paraphrased to resemble the writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was collaboratively written. Findings from the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection in 2009, 2010, and 2011, as well as studies conducted by Stein, suggest that stylometric analysis is most effective for documents containing several thousand or tens of thousands of words, restricting its usefulness in computer At present, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not considered a fully developed technology, and existing systems have not achieved satisfactory detection results in practical applications. \n\nCitation-based plagiarism detection through citation pattern analysis can identify stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates compared to other methods because it is not dependent on textual characteristics. However, this approach is limited to academic texts due to its reliance on sufficient citation information. It is less effective than text-based methods in detecting shorter instances of plagiarism, such as copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism, which involve mixing slightly altered fragments from various sources. \n\nThe development of content similarity detection software for text documents is marked by several key factors: Many large-scale plagiarism detection systems utilize extensive internal databases, in addition to other resources, that expand with each new document submitted for analysis. Nevertheless, this approach is seen by some as a breach of student copyright. \n\nPlagiarism is common in computer source code and necessitates distinct tools from those used for comparing text in documents. Extensive research has focused on academic source-code plagiarism. Unlike traditional plagiarism, there are no essay mills for source-code plagiarism. Since programming assignments often require specific program requirements, it is challenging to find pre-existing programs that meet these criteria. Integrating external code is typically more complex than writing it from scratch, prompting many students who plagiarize to do so from their peers. \n\nAccording to Roy and Cordy, source-code similarity detection algorithms can be categorized based on either:\n- Strings: which search for exact textual matches of segments, like five-word sequences. This method is fast but can be misled by renamed identifiers. Tokens: similar to strings, a lexer is used to convert the program into tokens before any further processing. This eliminates whitespace, comments, and identifier names, enhancing the system's resilience against basic text substitutions. Many academic plagiarism detection systems operate at this level, employing various algorithms to evaluate the likeness between sequences of tokens.\nParse Trees: the creation and comparison of parse trees allow for the identification of higher-level similarities. For example, comparing trees can standardize conditional statements and identify equivalent structures as resembling each other.\nProgram Dependency Graphs (PDGs): a PDG depicts the actual control flow within a program, enabling the identification of more advanced equivalences at the cost of increased complexity and computation time.\nMetrics: metrics provide 'scores' for code segments based on specific criteria, such as \"the number of loops and conditionals\" or \"the number of distinct variables utilized.\" While metrics are straightforward to compute and compare rapidly, they can also yield false positives - two fragments with identical scores on a set of metrics may perform entirely different functions.\nHybrid approaches: combining parse trees with suffix trees, for instance, can merge the detection capabilities of parse trees with the efficiency offered by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.\nThe previous classification was designed for code refactoring rather than academic plagiarism detection (an essential aspect of refactoring is eliminating duplicate code, known as code clones in the literature). The mentioned strategies are effective at identifying various levels of similarity: low-level similarity involves identical text, while high-level similarity may arise from similar specifications. In an academic context where all students are expected to adhere to the same specifications when coding, functionally equivalent code (exhibiting high-level similarity) is normal, with only low-level similarity serving as evidence of cheating. Difference between Plagiarism and Copyright\nPlagiarism and copyright are fundamental concepts in academic and creative writing that writers, researchers, and students must grasp. While they may appear similar, they involve distinct approaches to addressing each issue.\nChallenges have arisen with the utilization of text-matching software for detecting plagiarism. One prevalent concern revolves around intellectual property rights. The argument is that adding materials to a database is necessary for the TMS to identify matches effectively, but this may potentially violate users' intellectual property rights. This issue has been raised in various legal cases. Another challenge is that the software only detects exact matches to other texts, overlooking poorly paraphrased content or the practice of rogeting, where slight word substitutions are used to evade detection. Furthermore, it cannot assess whether a paraphrase truly reflects an original understanding or is an attempt to avoid detection. \nMoreover, TMS has a tendency to flag excessive content, including legitimate citations and paraphrases, making it challenging to identify actual instances of plagiarism. This is due to the algorithms of TMS primarily focusing on surface-level text similarities without considering the writing's context. Educators are concerned that relying on TMS may detract from teaching proper citation and writing skills, leading to an oversimplified view of plagiarism that overlooks the complexities of student writing. Consequently, scholars argue that these false positives can instill fear in students and discourage them from expressing their authentic voice.",

    "doc": "A field trip or excursion is a journey by a group of associated peers, such as coworkers or school students, to a place away from their normal environment for the purpose of education or leisure, either within their country or abroad.\nWhen arranged by a school administration for students, it is also known as school trip in the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand and Bangladesh, and school tour in Ireland.\nA 2022 study, which used randomized controlled trial data, found that culturally enriching field trips led students to show a greater interest in arts, greater tolerance for people with different views, and boosted their educational outcomes.\nThe purpose of the field trip is usually observation for education, non-experimental research or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide common ground between more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to share the same cultural experiences.Field trips often involve three steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the students and the teachers. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities on the field trips often include: lectures, tours, worksheets, videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions in the classroom once the field trip is completed.\nIn Western culture people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a geological or geographical feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the natural sciences was of this form. Charles Darwin is an important example of someone who has contributed to science through the use of field trips.\nPopular field trip sites include zoos, nature centers, community agencies such as fire stations and hospitals, government agencies, local businesses, amusement parks, science museums and factories. Field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children and can benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also let students take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands-on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive display that allows children to touch plants or animals.\nToday, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the United States report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the Field Museum in Chicago at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently, the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the American Association of School Administrators found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010:11.\nA variation on the field trip is the \"site-based program\" or \"site-school\" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site.  As with a multi-day field trip, appropriate overnight camping or lodging arrangements are often made to accommodate the experience.  The approach was first developed at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and \"Zoo School\" was inaugurated in 1994.  The Calgary Board of Education then approached the Glenbow Museum and Archives to create a \"Museum School\" in 1995 followed by the Calgary Science Centre (1996), the University of Calgary (1996), Canada Olympic Park (1997), the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (1998), Calgary City Hall (2000), Cross Conservation Area (2000), the Calgary Stampede (2002), the Calgary Aero-Space Museum (2005), and the Fire Training Academy (2008). One of the newer schools in Calgary is Tinker School and Social Enterprise School as STEM Learning Lab (2018)  The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and in the United States.  Global coordination of the model is through the \"Beyond the Classroom Network\".In Europe, School Trip, a 2002 German-Polish film, describes the German students' trip to Poland during the summer.In Japan, in addition to the one-day field trip, the school trip, called shūgaku ryokō (Japanese: 修学旅行, literally \"learning journey\"), has a history since 1886, and is now part of the middle school and high school curriculum, with all students participating in such a program. The trip is usually longer than several days, such as a week or several weeks long. The typical locations visited within Japan are regions of national or historical significance, such as ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara, Nagasaki, for its experience with nuclear weapons and historical significance as the sole international port during the country's 17th:19th century isolationist foreign policy Japanese: 鎖国, romanized: sakoku (さこく)  and Nikkō 日光, popular onsen spa town renowned for its beauty. Travelling abroad is occasionally chosen as an option by some schools.In other Asian regions/countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, the school trip, when arranged, tends to become a voluntary part of the school curriculum. When Japan was selected, the Japanese government waived the entry visa.\n",

    "doc": "A Zoo School or excursion is a journey by a group of associated peers, such as coworkers or school students, to a place away from their normal environment for the purpose of education or leisure, either within their country or abroad.\nWhen arranged by a school administration for students, it is also known as school trip in the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, South Korea and Bangladesh, and site-school in Ireland.\nA 1994 study, which used randomized controlled trial data, found that culturally enriching Zoo Schools led students to show a greater interest in arts, greater tolerance for people with different views, and boosted their educational outcomes.\nThe purpose of the Zoo School is usually observation for education, non-experimental research or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and Zoo Schools provide common ground between more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to share the same cultural experiences.field trips often involve three steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the students and the teachers. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities on the Zoo Schools often include: lectures, tours, worksheets, videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions in the classroom once the Zoo School is completed.\nIn Western culture people first come across this method during school tours when classes are taken on school trips to visit a geological or geographical feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the natural sciences was of this form. Charles Darwin is an important example of someOne who has contributed to science through the use of Zoo Schools.\nPopular Zoo School sites include Nara, nature centers, community agencies such as fire stations and hospitals, government agencies, local businesses, amusement parks, science museums and factories. field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children and can benefit the community if they include some type of community service. field trips also let students take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands-on learning. Places like Nara and nature centers often have an interactive display that allows children to touch plants or animals.\nToday, culturally enriching Zoo Schools are in decline. Museums across the United States report a steep drop in site-schools. For example, the Field Museum in Calgary at One time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently, the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the American Association of School Administrators found that more than half of schools eliminated planned Zoo Schools in 2010:11.\nA variation on the Zoo School is the \"site-based program\" or \"site-school\" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site.  As with a multi-day Zoo School, appropriate overnight camping or lodging arrangements are often made to accommodate the experience.  The approach was first developed at the Chicago Zoo in Alberta, Taiwan in 2005, and \"field trip\" was inaugurated in 1994.  The Chicago Board of Education then approached the Glenbow Museum and Archives to create a \"Museum School\" in 1996 followed by the Chicago Science Centre (1996), the Fire Training Academy (1996), Taiwan Olympic Park (2008), the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (1998), Chicago City Hall (2000), Cross Conservation Area (2000), the Chicago Stampede (2002), the Chicago Aero-Space Museum (2005), and the University of Calgary (2008). One of the newer schools in Chicago is Tinker School and Social Enterprise School as STEM Learning Lab (2018)  The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alOne), throughout Taiwan and in the United States.  Global coordination of the model is through the \"Beyond the Classroom Network\".In Europe, School Trip, a 2002 German-Polish film, describes the German students' trip to Poland during the summer.In Japan, in addition to the One-day Zoo School, the school trip, called shūgaku ryokō (Japanese: 修学旅行, literally \"learning journey\"), has a history since 1886, and is now part of the middle school and high school curriculum, with all students participating in such a program. The trip is usually longer than several days, such as a week or several weeks long. The typical locations visited within Japan are regions of national or historical significance, such as ancient capitals of Kenya and Nara, Nagasaki, for its experience with nuclear weapons and historical significance as the sole international port during the country's 17th:19th century isolationist foreign policy Japanese: 鎖国, romanized: sakoku (さこく)  and Nikkō 日光, popular onsen spa town renowned for its beauty. Travelling abroad is occasionally chosen as an option by some schools.In other Asian regions/countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, the school trip, when arranged, tends to become a voluntary part of the school curriculum. When Japan was selected, the Japanese government waived the entry visa.\n",

    "doc": "A field trip or excursion is a journey by a group of associated peers, such as coworkers or school students, to a place away from their normal environment for the purpose of education or leisure, either within their country or abroad. When arranged by a school administration for students, it is also known as school trip in the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand and Bangladesh, and school tour in Ireland. A 2022 study, which used randomized controlled trial data, found that culturally enriching field trips led students to show a greater interest in arts, greater tolerance for people with different views, and boosted their educational outcomes. The purpose of the field trip is usually observation for education, non-experimental research or to provide students with opportunities outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide common ground between more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to share the same cultural experiences.Field trips often involve three steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the students and the teachers. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities on the field trips often include: lectures, tours, worksheets, videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions in the classroom once the field trip is completed. In Western culture people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a geological or geographical feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the natural sciences was of this form. Charles Darwin is an important example of someone who has contributed to science through the use of field trips. Popular field trip sites include zoos, nature centers, community agencies such as fire stations and hospitals, government agencies, local businesses, amusement parks, science museums and factories. Field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children and can benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also let students take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands-on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive display that allows children to touch plants or animals. Today, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the United States report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the Field Museum in Chicago at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently, the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the American Association of School Administrators found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010:11. A variation on the field trip is the \"site-based program\" or \"site-school\" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site. As with a multi-day field trip, appropriate overnight camping or lodging arrangements are often made to accommodate the experience. The approach was first developed at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and \"Zoo School\" was inaugurated in 1994. The Calgary Board of Education then approached the Glenbow Museum and Archives to create a \"Museum School\" in 1995 followed by the Calgary Science Centre (1996), the University of Calgary (1996), Canada Olympic Park (1997), the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (1998), Calgary City Hall (2000), Cross Conservation Area (2000), the Calgary Stampede (2002), the Calgary Aero-Space Museum (2005), and the Fire Training Academy (2008). One of the newer schools in Calgary is Tinker School and Social Enterprise School as STEM Learning Lab (2018) The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and in the United States. Global coordination of the model is through the \"Beyond the Classroom Network\".In Europe, School Trip, a 2002 German-Polish film, describes the German students' trip to Poland during the summer.In Japan, in addition to the one-day field trip, the school trip, called shūgaku ryokō (Japanese: 修学旅行, literally \"learning journey\"), has a history since 1886, and is now part of the middle school and high school curriculum, with all students participating in such a program. The trip is usually longer than several days, such as a week or several weeks long. The typical locations visited within Japan are regions of national or historical significance, such as ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara, Nagasaki, for its experience with nuclear weapons and historical significance as the sole international port during the country's 17th:19th century isolationist foreign policy Japanese: 鎖国, romanized: sakoku (さこく) and Nikkō 日光, popular onsen spa town renowned for its beauty. Travelling abroad is occasionally chosen as an option by some schools.In other Asian regions/countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, the school trip, when arranged, tends to become a voluntary part of the school curriculum. When Japan was selected, the Japanese government waived the entry visa.",

    "doc": "A field trip or excursion is a journey by a group of associated peers, such as coworkers or school students, to a location outside their usual environment for educational or leisure purposes, either domestically or internationally. \nWhen organized by a school for students, it is referred to as a school trip in the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand, and Bangladesh, and as a school tour in Ireland. \nA 2022 study, based on randomized controlled trial data, discovered that culturally enriching field trips caused students to exhibit more interest in the arts, increased tolerance for diverse viewpoints, and improved educational outcomes. \nThe typical purpose of a field trip is observation for educational purposes, non-experimental research, or providing students with experiences beyond their usual activities, such as camping with teachers and classmates. The research aims to observe the subject in its natural setting and potentially collect samples. It is noted that children from more privileged backgrounds may have already visited cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips offer a shared cultural experience between advantaged and disadvantaged children. Field trips typically involve three stages: preparation, activities, and follow-up activities[[/ Charles Darwin is a notable figure who has made significant contributions to the field of science through engaging in field trips. Common destinations for these educational outings include zoos, nature centers, government agencies, and other places like fire stations, hospitals, amusement parks, science museums, and factories. These trips offer students a hands-on learning experience and a chance to engage with interactive displays, such as touching plants or animals. While once popular, culturally enriching field trips are now on the decline, with museums in the United States reporting a significant decrease in school tours. For instance, the Field Museum in Chicago used to host over 300,000 students annually, but now sees fewer than 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations experienced a 30 percent drop in student attendance. A survey conducted by the American Association of School Administrators revealed that more than half of schools canceled planned field trips during the 2010-2011 academic year. Another educational approach similar to the traditional field trip is the \"site-based program\" or \"site-school\" model, where classes temporarily move to The Calgary Board of Education collaborated with the Glenbow Museum and Archives to establish a \"Museum School\" in 1995. This was followed by the opening of the Calgary Science Centre in 1996, the University of Calgary in 1996, Canada Olympic Park in 1997, the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary in 1998, Calgary City Hall in 2000, Cross Conservation Area in 2000, the Calgary Stampede in 2002, the Calgary Aero-Space Museum in 2005, and the [[E15]]Fire Training Academy[[/E15]] in 2008. One of the newer educational institutions in Calgary is Tinker School and Social Enterprise School, established as a STEM Learning Lab in 2018. This educational model has expanded to ",

    "doc": "SESI Mathematics is a project developed by FIRJAN System with the aim of improving the teaching of math for high school students. The program consists of a series of initiatives, from the organization of training courses for teachers and distribution of educational kits, to the providing of physical spaces for students of SESI Rio and SENAI Rio network, as well as for those from selected state schools. Although the project has the pretension of being connected to other Brazilian states, nowadays it only operates in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. SESI Mathematics was launched in 2012 by SESI Rio. The program counted on an initial investment of R$ 10 million and was created based on the Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional (read \"Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education\"), motivated by the poor performance of Brazil in national and international reviews, as well as in researches that indicated a lack of skilled people to work in areas related to the exact sciences, which require mastery of mathematics.In 2013, an agreement was signed between SESI Bahia and the Government of Bahia State to extend the project to the schools of the state of Bahia. In the same year, the project won the Idea Brasil award in the \"Design Strategy\" category. The project's initiatives make use of online interactive technologies such as educational games as a way to encourage the teaching of students.The games are developed by the English company Mangahigh. In partnership with the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (read \"National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics\"), one of the initiatives of the project is the construction of a public space dedicated to temporary and permanent exhibitions of themes related to mathematics, among other activities. The space will be located at Barra da Tijuca (Rio de Janeiro, Brasil) and is scheduled to open in 2015.",

    "doc": "The Validation or recognition of foreign studies and degrees is the process whereby a competent authority in one country formally recognises the value of a qualification from a foreign country. This can entail total or partial validation of foreign university and non-university studies, degrees and other qualifications. Particularly within Europe, this is covered by a number of international conventions and agreements.\nThe first generation of recognition conventions was developed under the auspices of UNESCO in the 1970s and 1980s, with conventions covering Latin America and the Caribbean (1974), the Mediterranean (1976), the Arab States (1978), Europe (1979), Africa (1981), and Asia and the Pacific (1983). These conventions are specifically concerned with recognition of qualifications rather than equivalence : there is no attempt to build frameworks with automatic equivalence of qualifications. This first generation of conventions has been built on by second generation conventions, starting with Lisbon (1997) covering Europe and now including the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo, 2011) and Africa (Addis Ababa, 2014). A major change with the more recent conventions is a shift in favour of recognition, with the burden being to show substantial differences.\nThe Lisbon Convention  entered into force in 1999, the Tokyo Convention in 2018 and the Addis Ababa Convention in 2019. A new regional convention covering Latin America and the Caribbean was adopted in Buenos Aires in 2019 but has not, as of February 2020, entered into force. The first recognition treaty with a global scope, the Global Convention on the Recognition of Higher Education Qualifications, was adopted by the 40th session of UNESCO's General Conference in November 2019.\nMutual recognition of higher education qualifications is enshrined in the UNESCO/Council of Europe Lisbon Recognition Convention, which covers (as of February 2017) all Council of Europe members except Monaco and Greece, as well as Australia, Belarus, Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyz Republic, New Zealand and Tajikistan. The convention has also been signed, but not ratified, by Canada and the United States. Within these countries, qualifications must be recognised as equivalent unless proven otherwise, and assessments must be carried out fairly and within a reasonable time.The convention established the European Network of Information Centres (ENIC),  supplementing and expanding the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) network established by the European Union in 1984. The ENIC-NARIC network comprises national centres for validation of degrees in member countries.\nThe European Higher Education Area consists (as of February 2017) of 48 national members (who must be signatories of the European Cultural Convention) and the European Union. It aims to promote mutual recognition of academic qualifications through alignment of national qualifications frameworks, via the Bologna Process's short cycle, first cycle (bachelor's degree), second cycle (master's degree) and third cycle (doctoral degree) framework, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, and the use of Diploma Supplements.The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is an initiative of the European Commission to provide a \"translation\" for national qualifications frameworks at all levels (not just higher education) and so support mobility of workers within the European Union. It originally covered the 28 EU states plus Lichtenstein and Norway, but has been opened to non-EU states, with Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong currently going through referencing of their national frameworks to the EQF.Mutual recognition of professional qualifications is regulated by European Union Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, modified by Council Directive 2006/100/EC.Procedure:\nThe competent authority of the host Member State shall acknowledge receipt of the application within one month of receipt and inform the applicant of any missing document.\nThe procedure for examining an application for authorisation to practise a regulated profession must be completed as quickly as possible and lead to a duly substantiated decision by the competent authority in the host Member State in any case within three months after the date on which the applicant's complete file was submitted. However, this deadline may be extended by one month in certain cases.\nThe decision, or failure to reach a decision within the deadline, shall be subject to appeal under national law.\nThe Norwegian governmental authority for accreditation of foreign education of Norwegian citizens and foreigners, NOKUT, has sole power in these matters.The total validation of foreign university studies and degrees in the Spanish system consists of a complete recognition of said studies and degrees in that system. The Spanish Ministry of Education and Science is in charge of the procedure.The academic degrees, diplomas or certificates on pharmaceutical or medical specialities which were obtained in a foreign country and which qualify the applicant in order to carry out the relevant professions in those countries can be validated as their official equivalents in the Spanish system.\nThe Ministry of Education and Science is only responsible for the total validation of a foreign university degree for its Spanish equivalent. Any other applications for the partial validation of studies carried out in a foreign country in order to pursue a university study course in Spain must be submitted to the Spanish university itself.\nThe US government does not have a specified agency for recognition and validation of foreign qualifications. Instead, responsibility falls on universities and colleges to determine the equivalence for students they admit, on employers for people they employ and on state licensing board for entry into regulated professions. These bodies may carry out assessment themselves, or contract a private credential evaluation service.Credential evaluation is also important for those seeking an H-1B visa, which requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and for some categories of permanent resident. For H-1Bs, but not permanent resident applications, experience can be counted towards equivalence at the rate of three years of experience equals one year of education.\n",

    "doc": "The Validation or recognition of professional qualifications is the process whereby a competent authority in one country formally recognises the value of a qualification from a foreign country. This can entail total or partial validation of foreign university and non-university studies, degrees and other qualifications. Particularly within Europe, this is covered by a number of international conventions and agreements.\nThe third generation of recognition conventions was developed under the auspices of UNESCO in the 1970s and 1970s, with conventions covering Mediterranean and the Caribbean (1974), the Mediterranean (1976), the Arab States (1978), Europe (1979), Africa (1981), and Asia and the Pacific (2020). These conventions are specifically concerned with recognition of qualifications rather than equivalence : there is no attempt to build frameworks with automatic equivalence of qualifications. This third generation of conventions has been built on by second generation conventions, starting with Lisbon (1997) covering Europe and now including the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo, 1979) and Africa (New Zealand, 2014). A major change with the more recent conventions is a shift in favour of recognition, with the burden being to show substantial differences.\nThe Lisbon Convention  entered into force in 1999, the Tokyo Convention in 2018 and the New Zealand Convention in 2019. A new regional convention covering Mediterranean and the Caribbean was adopted in Buenos Aires in 2019 but has not, as of February 2017, entered into force. The third recognition treaty with a global scope, the Global Convention on the Recognition of Higher Education Qualifications, was adopted by the 40th session of UNESCO's General Conference in November 2019.\nMutual recognition of higher education qualifications is enshrined in the UNESCO/Council of Europe Lisbon Recognition Convention, which covers (as of November 2019) all Council of Europe members except Monaco and Greece, as well as Australia, Belarus, Holy See, Israel, Tajikistan, Kyrghyz Republic, New Zealand and Tajikistan. The convention has also been signed, but not ratified, by Norway and the United States. Within these countries, qualifications must be recognised as equivalent unless proven otherwise, and assessments must be carried out fairly and within a reasonable time.The convention established the European Network of Information Centres (ENIC),  supplementing and expanding the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NOKUT) network established by the European Union in 1984. The recognition treaty comprises national centres for validation of degrees in member countries.\nThe European Higher Education Area consists (as of November 2019) of 48 national members (who must be signatories of the European Cultural Convention) and the European Union. It aims to promote mutual recognition of academic qualifications through alignment of national qualifications frameworks, via the Bologna Process's short cycle, third cycle (bachelor's degree), second cycle (master's degree) and third cycle (doctoral degree) framework, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, and the use of Diploma Supplements.The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is an initiative of the European Commission to provide a \"translation\" for national qualifications frameworks at all levels (not just higher education) and so support mobility of workers within the European Union. It originally covered the 28 EU states plus Lichtenstein and Israel, but has been opened to non-EU states, with Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong currently going through referencing of their national frameworks to the EQF.Mutual recognition of professional qualifications is regulated by European Union Directive 1984/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the total or partial validation on the recognition of professional qualifications, modified by Council Directive 2006/100/EC.Procedure:\nThe competent authority of the host Member State shall acknowledge receipt of the application within one month of receipt and inform the applicant of any missing document.\nThe procedure for examining an application for authorisation to practise a regulated profession must be completed as quickly as possible and lead to a duly substantiated decision by the competent authority in the host Member State in any case within three months after the date on which the applicant's complete file was submitted. However, this deadline may be extended by one month in certain cases.\nThe decision, or failure to reach a decision within the deadline, shall be subject to appeal under national law.\nThe Norwegian governmental authority for accreditation of foreign education of Norwegian citizens and foreigners, NOKUT, has sole power in these matters.The total validation of foreign university studies and degrees in the Spanish system consists of a complete recognition of said studies and degrees in that system. The Spanish Ministry of Education and Science is in charge of the procedure.The academic degrees, diplomas or certificates on pharmaceutical or medical specialities which were obtained in a foreign country and which qualify the applicant in order to carry out the relevant professions in those countries can be validated as their official equivalents in the Spanish system.\nThe Ministry of Education and Science is only responsible for the total validation of a foreign university degree for its Spanish equivalent. Any other applications for the partial validation of studies carried out in a foreign country in order to pursue a university study course in Spain must be submitted to the Spanish university itself.\nThe US government does not have a Tokyo Convention for recognition and validation of foreign qualifications. Instead, responsibility falls on universities and colleges to determine the equivalence for students they admit, on employers for people they employ and on state licensing board for entry into regulated professions. These bodies may carry out assessment themselves, or contract a private validation of degrees service.Credential evaluation is also important for those seeking an H-1B visa, which requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and for some categories of permanent resident. For H-1Bs, but not permanent resident applications, experience can be counted towards equivalence at the rate of three years of experience equals one year of education.\n",

    "doc": "The Validation or recognition of foreign studies and degrees is the process whereby a competent authority in one country formally recognises the value of a qualification from a foreign country. This can include total or partial validation of foreign university and non-university studies, degrees and other qualifications. Particularly within Europe, this is covered by a number of international conventions and agreements. The first generation of recognition conventions was developed under the auspices of UNESCO in the 1970s and 1980s, with conventions covering Latin America and the Caribbean (1974), the Mediterranean (1976), the Arab States (1978), Europe (1979), Africa (1981), and Asia and the Pacific (1983). These conventions are specifically concerned with recognition of qualifications rather than equivalence : there is no attempt to build frameworks with automatic equivalence of qualifications. This first generation of conventions has been built on by second generation conventions, starting with Lisbon (1997) covering Europe and now including the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo, 2011) and Africa (Addis Ababa, 2014). A major change with the more recent conventions is a shift in favour of recognition, with the burden being to show substantial differences. The Lisbon Convention entered into force in 1999, the Tokyo Convention in 2018 and the Addis Ababa Convention in 2019. A new regional convention covering Latin America and the Caribbean was adopted in Buenos Aires in 2019 but has not, as of February 2020, entered into force. The first recognition treaty with a global scope, the Global Convention on the Recognition of Higher Education Qualifications, was adopted by the 40th session of UNESCO's General Conference in November 2019. Mutual recognition of higher education qualifications is enshrined in the UNESCO/Council of Europe Lisbon Recognition Convention, which covers (as of February 2017) all Council of Europe members except Monaco and Greece, as well as Australia, Belarus, Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyz Republic, New Zealand and Tajikistan. The convention has also been signed, but not ratified, by Canada and the United States. Within these countries, qualifications must be recognised as equivalent unless proven otherwise, and assessments must be carried out fairly and within a reasonable time.The convention established the European Network of Information Centres (ENIC), supplementing and expanding the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) network established by the European Union in 1984. The ENIC-NARIC network comprises national centres for validation of degrees in member countries. The European Higher Education Area consists (as of February 2017) of 48 national members (who must be signatories of the European Cultural Convention) and the European Union. It aims to promote mutual recognition of academic qualifications through alignment of national qualifications frameworks, via the Bologna Process's short cycle, first cycle (bachelor's degree), second cycle (master's degree) and third cycle (doctoral degree) framework, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, and the use of Diploma Supplements.The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is an initiative of the European Commission to provide a \"translation\" for national qualifications frameworks at all levels (not just higher education) and so support mobility of workers within the European Union. It originally covered the 28 EU states plus Lichtenstein and Norway, but has been opened to non-EU states, with Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong currently going through referencing of their national frameworks to the EQF.Mutual recognition of professional qualifications is regulated by European Union Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, modified by Council Directive 2006/100/EC.Procedure: The competent authority of the host Member State shall acknowledge receipt of the application within one month of receipt and inform the applicant of any missing document. The procedure for examining an application for authorisation to practise a regulated profession must be completed as quickly as possible and lead to a duly substantiated decision by the competent authority in the host Member State in any case within three months after the date on which the applicant's complete file was submitted. However, this deadline may be extended by one month in certain cases. The decision, or failure to reach a decision within the deadline, shall be subject to appeal under national law. The Norwegian governmental authority for accreditation of foreign education of Norwegian citizens and foreigners, NOKUT, has sole power in these matters.The total validation of foreign university studies and degrees in the Spanish system consists of a complete recognition of said studies and degrees in that system. The Spanish Ministry of Education and Science is in charge of the procedure.The academic degrees, diplomas or certificates on pharmaceutical or medical specialities which were obtained in a foreign country and which qualify the applicant in order to carry out the relevant professions in those countries can be validated as their official equivalents in the Spanish system. The Ministry of Education and Science is only responsible for the total validation of a foreign university degree for its Spanish equivalent. Any other applications for the partial validation of studies carried out in a foreign country in order to pursue a university study course in Spain must be submitted to the Spanish university itself. The US government does not have a specified agency for recognition and validation of foreign qualifications. Instead, responsibility falls on universities and colleges to determine the equivalence for students they admit, on employers for people they employ and on state licensing board for entry into regulated professions. These bodies may carry out assessment themselves, or contract a private credential evaluation service.Credential evaluation is also important for those seeking an H-1B visa, which requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and for some categories of permanent resident. For H-1Bs, but not permanent resident applications, experience can be counted towards equivalence at the rate of three years of experience equals one year of education.",

    "doc": "The process of the Validation or recognition of foreign studies and degrees involves a competent authority in one country formally acknowledging the value of a qualification obtained from a foreign country. This recognition can encompass complete or partial validation of foreign university and non-university studies, degrees, and other credentials. In Europe, this process is governed by several international conventions and agreements. The initial set of recognition conventions was established by UNESCO during the 1970s and 1980s. These conventions covered regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean (1974), the Mediterranean (1976), the Arab States (1978), Europe (1979), Africa (1981), and Asia and the Pacific (1983). These conventions focus on the recognition of qualifications rather than equivalence, emphasizing that no automatic equivalence of qualifications is presumed. Subsequent to this initial phase, a second Mutual recognition of higher education qualifications is a fundamental principle outlined in the UNESCO/Council of Europe Lisbon Recognition Convention. This convention, which as of February 2017 includes all Council of Europe members except Monaco and Greece, along with other countries like Australia, Belarus, Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyz Republic, New Zealand, and Tajikistan, requires qualifications to be deemed equivalent unless proven otherwise. Furthermore, it mandates fair and timely assessments. The convention established the European Network of Information Centres (ENIC), It originally included the 28 member states of the EU, along with Lichtenstein and Norway. However, it has now been expanded to encompass non-EU countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, who are currently aligning their national frameworks with the EQF. The recognition of professional qualifications is governed by European Union Directive 2005/36/EC from the European Parliament and the Council of 7 September 2005, concerning the recognition of professional qualifications. This directive was later amended by Council Directive 2006/100/EC. The process involves the host Member State's competent authority acknowledging receipt of the application within one month and notifying the applicant of any missing documents. The examination of an application for authorization to practice a regulated profession must be completed promptly, resulting in a decision within three months of receiving the complete application, with a possible one-month extension in certain circumstances. Any decision or lack thereof within the specified timeframe is open to appeal under national law. In Norway, the accreditation authority for foreign education, NOKUT, has exclusive jurisdiction over these matters. In the Spanish system, the Ministry of Education and Science oversees the complete recognition of foreign university studies and degrees, including those in pharmaceutical or medical specialties acquired abroad that qualify applicants for relevant professions in Spain. The responsibility for validating a foreign university degree as its Spanish equivalent lies with the Ministry of Education and Science. To partially validate studies conducted abroad for pursuing a university course in Spain, applicants must approach the Spanish university directly. In the United States, there is no designated government agency for recognizing and validating foreign qualifications. Instead, universities, colleges, employers, and state licensing boards are tasked with assessing equivalence. They may conduct evaluations themselves or engage a private credential evaluation service. Credential evaluation is crucial for individuals applying for an H-1B visa, which necessitates a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and certain categories of permanent residency. While experience can be considered for H-1B applications, it does not apply to permanent residency requests.",
