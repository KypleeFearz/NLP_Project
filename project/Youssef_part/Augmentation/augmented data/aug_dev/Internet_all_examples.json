After the bill passed second reading on the floor of the Nigeria Senate and its details were made public, information emerged on the social media accusing the sponsor of the bill of plagiarising a similar law in Singapore which is at the bottom of global ranking in the freedom of speech and of the press. But the senator denied that he plagiarised Singaporean law.\nAngry reactions trailed the introduction of the bill, and a number of civil society organisations, human rights activists, and Nigerian citizens unanimously opposed the bill. International rights group, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the proposed legislation saying it is aimed at gagging freedom of speech which is a universal right in a country of over two hundred million people.Opposition political parties are very critical of the bill and accused the government of attempting to strip bare, Nigerian citizens of their rights to free speech and destroying same social media on whose power and influence the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC came to power in 2015. Nigeria Information Minister, Lai Mohammed has been at the center of public criticism because he is suspected to be the brain behind the proposed act.

    "doc": "Anti-social Media Bill was introduced by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 5 November 2019 to criminalise the use of the social media in peddling false or malicious information. The original title of the bill is Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill 2019. It was sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from the largely conservative northern Nigeria. After the legislation passed second reading on the floor of the Nigeria Senate and its details were made public, information emerged on the social media accusing the sponsor of the bill of plagiarising a similar law in Singapore which is at the bottom of global ranking in the freedom of speech and of the press. But the senator denied that he plagiarised Singaporean law. Angry reactions trailed the introduction of the bill, and a number of civil society organisations, human rights activists, and Nigerian citizens unanimously opposed the bill. International rights group, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the proposed legislation saying it is aimed at gagging freedom of speech which is a universal right in a country of over two hundred million people.Opposition political parties are very critical of the bill and accused the government of attempting to strip bare, Nigerian citizens of their rights to free speech and destroying same social media on whose power and influence the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC came to power in 2015. Nigeria Information Minister, Lai Mohammed has been at the center of public criticism because he is suspected to be the brain behind the proposed act. Lai was a former spokesman of then opposition All Progressives Congress. A \"Stop the Social Media Bill! You can no longer take our rights from us\" online petition campaign to force the Nigeria parliament to drop the bill received over 90,000 signatures within 24 hours. In November 2019, after the bill passed second reading in the senate, Akon Eyakenyi, a senator from Akwa Ibom State publicly said he would resist the bill. Those who support the proposed act especially Senators have often argued that the law would help curtail hate speech. President Muhammad Buhari who is seen as a beneficiary of the influence and power of the social media and free speech has been mute about it. But the president's senior aides and family members have publicly spoken in support of the bill. In November 2019, the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, told a gathering at the Nigeria's National Mosque in the capital, Abuja that if China with over one billion people could regulate the social media, Nigeria should do same. But Nigerians reacted saying Nigeria is not a one-party communist state like China. Days later, a daughter to the president, Zahra Indimi told a gathering of young people in Abuja that social media had become a potent weapon for bullying those they thought were doing better than them in terms of social class and called for a critical regulation.Protection from Internet Falsehoods, Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019.This Act is to prevent Falsehoods and Manipulations in Internet transmission and correspondences in Nigeria.To suppress falsehoods and manipulations and counter the effects of such communications and transmissions and to sanction offenders with a view to encouraging and enhancing transparency by Social Media Platforms using the internet correspondences. One objective of the bill is to prevent the transmission of false statements or declaration of facts in Nigeria.Another objective of the bill is to end the financing of online mediums that transmit false statements. Measures will be taken to detect and control inauthentic behaviour and misuse of online accounts (parody accounts). When paid content is posted towards a political end, there will be measures to ensure the poster discloses such information. There will be sanction for offenders. According to the bill, a person must not:Transmit a statement that is false or, Transmit a statement that might: i. Affect the security or any part of Nigeria. ii. Affect public health, public safety or public finance. iii. Affect Nigeria's relationship with other countries. iv. influence the outcome of an election to any office in a general election. v. Cause enmity or hatred towards a person or group of persons. Anyone guilty of the above is liable to a fine of N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individual); and a fine not exceeding ten million naira (for corporate organisations). Same punishment applies for fake online accounts that transmit statements listed above. The bill says a person shall not open an account to transmit false statement.Anyone found guilty will be fined N200,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for an individual) or five million naira (for corporate organisations). If such accounts transmit a statement that will affect security or influence the outcome of an election, such a person will be fined N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. If a person receives payment or reward to help another to transmit false statements knowingly, he/she is liable to a fine of N150,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. If a person receives payment or reward to help another to transmit a statement affects security or influence the outcome of an election, the fine is N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individual) and ten million naira for organisations. According to the bill, a law enforcement department can issue a \"declaration\" to offenders. And this declaration will be issued even if the \"false statement\" has been corrected or pulled down.The offender will be required to publish a \"correction notice\" in a specified newspaper, online location or other printed publication of Nigeria. Failure to comply, a person is liable to N200,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both (for individual) and five million naira for organisations. The bill says the law enforcement department will also issue an access blocking order to offenders.The law enforcement department may direct the NCC to order the internet access service provider to disable access by users in Nigeria to the online location and the NCC must give the internet access service provider an access blocking order. An internet access service provider that does not comply with any access blocking order is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding ten million naira for each day during any part of which that order is not fully complied with, up to a total of five million naira.",

    "doc": "Anti-social Media Bill was presented by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 5 November 2019 with the aim of criminalizing the dissemination of false or harmful information through social media. The bill, originally known as the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill 2019, was put forward by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from the predominantly conservative northern region of Nigeria. Despite denials from the senator, allegations emerged on social media accusing him of copying a law from Singapore, a country known for strict limits on freedom of speech and press freedom. The bill sparked widespread backlash from civil society organizations, human rights activists, and Nigerian citizens, all of whom united in opposition. International groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the bill, claiming it was an attempt to stifle free speech in a nation of over two hundred million people. Opposition parties criticized the bill, accusing the government of infringing on citizens' rights and undermining the role of social media in the ruling [[ The \"You can no longer take our rights from us\" online petition campaign aimed at pressuring the Nigerian parliament to withdraw a bill gathered more than 90,000 signatures in just 24 hours. In November 2019, following the bill's advancement to the second reading in the senate, Senator Akon Eyakenyi from Akwa Ibom State publicly declared her opposition to the bill. Advocates of the proposed legislation, particularly Senators, argue that it would help combat hate speech. President Muhammad Buhari, who has benefited from social media and free speech, has not commented on the bill, but his senior aides and family members have expressed support for it. In November 2019, Aisha Buhari, the wife of the president, stated at Nigeria's National Mosque in Abuja that Nigeria should regulate social media like China, citing China's regulations despite opposition claiming Nigeria is not a one-party communist state like China. Zahra Indimi, the president's daughter, later spoke in Abuja about the negative aspects of social media and called for careful regulation. The Protection from Internet Falsehoods, Manipulations, and Other Related Matters Bill of 2019 aims to prevent falsehoods and manipulations in internet communications in Nigeria by penalizing offenders to promote transparency on social media platforms. One aim of the legislation is to prevent the spread of false information in Nigeria, as well as to halt funding for online platforms that propagate falsehoods. Steps will be taken to identify and curb deceptive practices and the misuse of online profiles (such as parody accounts). In cases where paid content is shared for political purposes, measures will be enforced to ensure transparency regarding the source. Penalties will be imposed on violators. The bill outlines that individuals are prohibited from disseminating false statements that could jeopardize the security of Nigeria, impact public health, safety, or finances, damage international relations, sway election outcomes, or incite hatred. Those found guilty may face a fine of N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individuals), and a fine up to ten million naira (for corporate entities). The same penalties apply to fake online accounts spreading such statements. It is also prohibited to create an account with the intent to share false information, punishable by a fine of N200,000 or three years' imprisonment or both (for individuals), or a fine of five million naira (for corporations). Transmitting false statements through these accounts that impact security or election results may result in a fine of N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. If a person is paid to aid in disseminating false information, they may face a fine of N150,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. If an individual receives payment or reward to assist in transmitting a statement that impacts security or influences the outcome of an election, they may face a fine of N300,000 or three years' imprisonment or both. Organizations, on the other hand, could be fined ten million naira. As per the legislation, law enforcement agencies have the authority to issue a \"declaration\" to offenders, even if the \"false statement\" has been corrected or removed. The individual must then publish a \"correction notice\" in a designated newspaper, online platform, or other printed publication in Nigeria. Failure to comply could result in a penalty of N200,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both for individuals, and five million naira for organizations. Furthermore, the law enforcement department is empowered to issue an access blocking order to offenders. They may direct the NCC to instruct internet service providers to block access by users in Nigeria to the specified online location, and the NCC must ensure compliance. Any internet service provider failing to comply with the access blocking order may face a fine of up to ten million naira per day of non-com",

    "doc": "Internet GIS, or Internet geographic information system (GIS), is a term that refers to a broad set of technologies and applications that employ the Internet to access, analyze, visualize, and distribute spatial data. Internet GIS is an outgrowth of traditional GIS, and represents a shift from conducting GIS on an individual computer to working with remotely distributed data and functions. Two major issues in GIS are accessing and distributing spatial data and GIS outputs. Internet GIS helps to solve that problem by allowing users to access vast databases impossible to store on a single desktop computer, and by allowing rapid dissemination of both maps and raw data to others. These methods include both file sharing and email. This has enabled the general public to participate in map creation and make use of GIS technology.\nInternet GIS is a subset of Distributed GIS, but specifically uses the internet rather than generic computer networks. Internet GIS applications are often, but not exclusively, conducted through the World Wide Web (also known as the Web), giving rise to the sub-branch of Web GIS, often used interchangeably with Internet GIS.  While Web GIS has become nearly synonymous with Internet GIS to many in the industry, the two are as distinct as the internet is from the World Wide Web. Likewise, Internet GIS is as distinct from distributed GIS as the Internet is from distributed computer networks in general.\nInternet GIS includes services beyond those enabled by the Web. Use of any other internet-enabled services to facilitate GIS functions, even if used in conjuncture with the Web, represents the use of Internet GIS. One of the most common applications of a distributed GIS system, accessing remotely saved data, can be done through the internet without the need for the Web. This is often done in practice when data are sensitive, such as hospital patient data and research facilities proprietary data, where sending data through the Web may be a security risk. This can be done using a Virtual private network (VPN) to access a local network remotely. The use of VPN for these purposes surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when employers needed to allow employees using GIS access to sensitive spatial data from home.\nThe history of Internet geographic information systems is linked to the history of the computer, the internet, and the quantitative revolution in geography. Geography tends to adapt technologies from other disciplines rather than innovating and inventing the technologies employed to conduct geographic studies. The computer and internet are not an exception, and were rapidly investigated to purpose towards the needs of geographers. In 1959, Waldo Tobler published the first paper detailing the use of computers in map creation. This was the beginning of computer cartography, or the use of computers to create maps. In 1960, the first true geographic information system capable of storing, analyzing, changing, and creating visualizations with spatial data was created by Roger Tomlinson on behalf of the Canadian Government to manage natural resources. These technologies represented a paradigm shift in cartography and geography, with desktop computer cartography facilitated through GIS rapidly replaced traditional ways of making maps. The emergence of GIS and computer technology contributed to the quantitative revolution in geography and the emergence of the branch of technical geography.As computer technology advanced the desktop machine became the default for producing maps, a process known as digital mapping, or computer cartography. These computers were networked together to share data and processing power and create redundant communications for defense applications. This computer network evolved into the internet, and by the late 1980s, the internet was available in some people's homes. Over time, the internet moved from a novelty to a major part of daily life. Using the internet, it was no longer necessary to store all data for a project locally, and communications were vastly improved. Following this trend, GIScientists began developing methods for combining the internet and GIS. This process accelerated in the 1990s, with the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990 and the first major web mapping program, Xerox PARC Map Viewer, capable of distributed map creation appearing in 1993. This software was unique in that it facilitated dynamic user map generation, rather than static images. These new Web-based programs helped users to employ GIS without having it locally installed on their machine, ultimately leading to Web GIS being the dominant way users interact with internet GIS.\nIn 1995 The US federal government made the TIGER Mapping Service available to the public, facilitating desktop and Web GIS by hosting US boundary data. This data availability, facilitated through the internet, silently revolutionized cartography by providing the world with authoritative boundary files, for free. In 1996, MapQuest became available to the public, facilitating navigation and trip planning. Sometime during the 1990s, more maps were transmitted over the internet than physically printed. This milestone was predicted in 1985 and represented a major shift in how we distribute spatial products to the masses.\nAs of 2020, almost 75% of the population has a smartphone.  These devices allow users to access the internet wherever they have service, and have revolutionized how we interact with the internet. One notable example is the rise of \nmobile apps, which have impacted both how GIS is done, and how data are collected. Some mobile apps like the Google Maps mobile app are web-based and allow users to get navigation instructions in real time. Others, like Esri's Survey123 allow users to collect data in the field with their smartphone. As time progresses, internet-based applications that do not make use of HTML or Web Browsers have begun to become to grow in popularity.\nThe World Wide Web is an information system that uses the internet to host, share, and distribute documents, images, and other data. Web GIS involves using the World Wide Web to facilitate GIS tasks traditionally done on a desktop computer, as well as enabling the sharing of maps and spatial data. Most, but not all, internet GIS is Web GIS, however all Web GIS is internet GIS. This is quite similar to how much of the activity on the internet is hosted on the World Wide Web, but not everything on the internet is the World Wide Web. The tasks Web GIS are used for are numerous but can be generally divided into the categories of Geospatial web services: web feature services, web processing services, and web mapping services.By their definition, maps can never be perfect and are simplifications of reality. Ethical cartographers try to keep these inaccuracies documented and to a minimum, while encouraging critical perspectives when using a map. Internet GIS has brought map-making tools to the general public, facilitating the rapidly disseminating these maps. While this is potentially positive, it also means that people without cartographic training can easily make and disseminate misleading maps to a wide audience. This was brought to public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more than half of all United States state government COVID-19 dashboards had cartographic errors. Further, malicious actors can quickly spread intentionally misleading spatial information while hiding the source. As the internet is decentralized, traditional solutions to problems such as government regulation are difficult or impossible to implement. For many users, the World Wide Web is synonymous with the Internet, which is true for Internet GIS. Most functions done with Internet GIS are conducted through the use of Web GIS. This has caused the borders between the two terms to blur, and \"Web GIS\" to become genericized into meaning any GIS done over the internet to some users.\n",

This process accelerated in the 1990s, with the creation of the World Wide VPN in 1990 and the first major web mapping program, Xerox PARC Map Viewer, capable of distributed map creation appearing in 1993. This software was unique in that it facilitated dynamic user map generation, rather than static images. These new VPN-based programs helped users to employ GIS without having it locally installed on their machine, ultimately leading to VPN GIS being the dominant way users interact with Internet GIS.\nIn 1995 The US federal government made the TIGER Mapping Service available to the public, facilitating desktop and VPN GIS by hosting US boundary data. This data availability, facilitated through the internet, silently revolutionized cartography by providing the world with authoritative boundary files, for free. In 1996, MapQuest became available to the public, facilitating navigation and trip planning. Sometime during the 1990s, more maps were transmitted over the internet than physically printed. This milestone was predicted in 1995 and represented a major shift in how we distribute spatial products to the masses.\nAs of 2020, almost 75% of the population has a smartphone.  These devices allow users to access the internet wherever they have service, and have revolutionized how we interact with the internet. One notable example is the rise of \nmobile apps, which have impacted both how GIS is done, and how data are collected. Some mobile apps like the Google Maps mobile app are web-based and allow users to get navigation instructions in real time. Others, like Esri's Survey123 allow users to collect data in the field with their smartphone. As time progresses, internet-based applications that do not make use of HTML or VPN Browsers have begun to become to grow in popularity.\nThe World Wide VPN is an information system that uses the internet to host, share, and distribute documents, images, and other data. VPN GIS involves using the World Wide VPN to facilitate GIS tasks traditionally done on a desktop computer, as well as enabling the sharing of maps and spatial data. Most, but not all, Internet GIS is VPN GIS, however all VPN GIS is Internet GIS. This is quite similar to how much of the activity on the internet is hosted on the World Wide VPN, but not everything on the internet is the World Wide VPN. The tasks VPN GIS are used for are numerous but can be generally divided into the categories of Geospatial web services: web feature services, web processing services, and web mapping services.By their definition, maps can never be perfect and are simplifications of reality. Ethical cartographers try to keep these inaccuracies documented and to a minimum, while encouraging critical perspectives when using a map. COVID-19 GIS has brought map-making tools to the general public, facilitating the rapidly disseminating these maps. While this is potentially positive, it also means that people without cartographic training can easily make and disseminate misleading maps to a wide audience. This was brought to public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more than half of all United States state government COVID-19 dashboards had cartographic errors. Further, malicious actors can quickly spread intentionally misleading spatial information while hiding the source. As the internet is decentralized, traditional solutions to problems such as government regulation are difficult or impossible to implement. For many users, the World Wide VPN is synonymous with the COVID-19, which is true for COVID-19 GIS. Most functions done with COVID-19 GIS are conducted through the use of VPN GIS. This has caused the borders between the two terms to blur, and \"VPN GIS\" to become genericized into meaning any GIS done over the internet to some users.\n",

    "doc": "Internet GIS, or Internet geographic information system (GIS), is a term that refers to a broad set of technologies and applications that employ the Internet to access, analyze, visualize, and distribute spatial data Internet GIS is an outgrowth of traditional GIS, and represents a shift from conducting GIS on an individual computer to working with remotely distributed data and functions. Two major issues in GIS are accessing and distributing spatial data and GIS outputs. Internet GIS helps to solve that problem by allowing users to access vast databases impossible to store on a single desktop computer, and by allowing rapid dissemination of both maps and raw data to others. These methods include both file sharing and email. This has enabled the general public to participate in map creation and make use of GIS technology. Internet GIS is a subset of Distributed GIS, but specifically uses the internet rather than generic computer networks. Internet GIS applications are often, but not exclusively, conducted through the World Wide Web (also known as the Web), giving rise to the sub-branch of Web GIS, often used interchangeably with Internet GIS. While Web GIS has become nearly synonymous with Internet GIS to many in the industry, the two are as distinct as the internet is from the World Wide Web. Likewise, Internet GIS is as distinct from distributed GIS as the Internet is from distributed computer networks in general. Internet GIS includes services beyond those enabled by the Web. Use of any other internet-enabled services to facilitate GIS functions, even if used in conjuncture with the Web, represents the use of Internet GIS. One of the most common applications of a distributed GIS system, accessing remotely saved data, can be done through the internet without the need for the Web. This is often done in practice when data are sensitive, such as hospital patient data and research facilities proprietary data, where sending data through the Web may be a security risk. This can be done using a Virtual private network (VPN) to access a local network remotely. The use of VPN for these purposes surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when employers needed to allow employees using GIS access to sensitive spatial data from home. The history of Internet geographic information systems is linked to the history of the computer, the internet, and the quantitative revolution in geography. Geography tends to adapt technologies from other disciplines rather than innovating and inventing the technologies employed to conduct geographic studies. The computer and internet are not an exception, and were rapidly investigated to purpose towards the needs of geographers. In 1959, Waldo Tobler published the first paper detailing the use of computers in map creation. This was the beginning of computer cartography, or the use of computers to create maps. In 1960, the first true geographic information system capable of storing, analyzing, changing, and creating visualizations with spatial data was created by Roger Tomlinson on behalf of the Canadian Government to manage natural resources. These technologies represented a paradigm shift in cartography and geography, with desktop computer cartography facilitated through GIS rapidly replaced traditional ways of making maps. The emergence of GIS and computer technology contributed to the quantitative revolution in geography and the emergence of the branch of technical geography.As computer technology advanced the desktop machine became the default for producing maps, a process known as digital mapping, or computer cartography. These computers were networked together to share data and processing power and create redundant communications for defense applications. This computer network evolved into the internet, and by the late 1980s, the internet was available in some people's homes. Over time, the internet moved from a novelty to a major part of daily life. Using the internet, it was no longer necessary to store all data for a project locally, and communications were vastly improved. Following this trend, GIScientists began developing methods for combining the internet and GIS. This process accelerated in the 1990s, with the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990 and the first major web mapping program, Xerox PARC Map Viewer, capable of distributed map creation appearing in 1993.

    "doc": "Internet GIS, also known as Internet geographic information system (GIS), encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications that utilize the Internet for accessing, analyzing, visualizing, and disseminating spatial data. This evolution from traditional GIS involves shifting from local computer-based operations to working with data and functions distributed remotely. A key focus of GIS involves dealing with the challenges of accessing and sharing spatial data and outputs. Internet GIS addresses these challenges by enabling users to tap into vast databases that are impractical to store on a single computer, as well as facilitating quick sharing of maps and raw data through methods like file sharing and email. This accessibility has opened up opportunities for the public to engage in map creation and leverage GIS technology. \nInternet GIS falls under the umbrella of Distributed GIS, but distinctively relies on the internet rather than conventional computer networks. Applications of Internet GIS are commonly conducted via the World Wide Web (or the Web), giving rise to the related field of Web GIS, often used interchangeably with Internet[[/E This is often done in practice when data are sensitive, such as hospital patient data and research facilities' proprietary data, where sending data through the Web may pose a security risk. A solution to this issue is using a Virtual private network (VPN) to remotely access a local network. The utilization of VPN for these purposes saw a significant increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, as employers needed to enable employees using GIS to access sensitive spatial data from their homes. \n\nThe evolution of Internet geographic information systems is intertwined with the development of computers, the internet, and the quantitative revolution in geography. Geography tends to adopt technologies from other fields rather than creating them. The computer and internet were swiftly explored to meet the needs of geographers. In 1959, the first paper on using computers for map creation was published by Waldo Tobler. This marked the start of computer cartography, or the use of computers to make maps. By 1960, the first true geographic information system capable of storing, analyzing, changing, and visualizing spatial data was developed by Roger Tomlinson for the Canadian Government to manage natural resources. These advancements signaled a shift in cartography and geography, with GIS on desktop computers quickly replacing traditional map-making methods. The rise of GIS and computer technology played a key role in the quantitative revolution in geography, leading to the The computer network eventually transformed into the internet, and by the late 1980s, some people had access to the internet in their homes. Gradually, the internet transitioned from a novelty to an essential part of daily life, enhancing data storage capabilities for projects and improving communication. In response to this shift, GIS scientists started developing techniques to merge the internet with GIS. This integration gained momentum in the 1990s, marked by the launch of the World Wide Web in 1990 and the introduction of the first significant web mapping tool, Xerox PARC Map Viewer, capable of creating maps collaboratively in 1993. Notably, this software allowed for dynamic user-generated maps rather than static images. These innovative Web-based applications enabled users to utilize GIS without local installation, establishing Web GIS as the primary means of interacting with internet GIS. \nBy 1995, the US federal government had made the TIGER Mapping Service publicly accessible, facilitating desktop and Web [[ Some mobile apps, such as the Google Maps mobile app, are web-based and provide real-time navigation instructions to users. On the other hand, apps like Esri's Survey123 allow users to gather data in the field using their smartphones. Over time, there has been a rise in the popularity of internet-based applications that do not rely on HTML or Web Browsers.\n\nThe World Wide Web is an information system that utilizes the internet to store, distribute, and share documents, images, and other data. Web GIS involves using the World Wide Web to facilitate GIS tasks that were traditionally carried out on desktop computers, as well as enabling the sharing of maps and spatial data. While most internet GIS is web GIS, not all web GIS is internet GIS. This is similar to how much of the internet's activity is hosted on the World Wide Web, but not everything on the internet is part of the World Wide Web.\n\nWeb GIS tasks can be categorized into web feature services, web processing services, and web mapping services. Maps, by nature, are simplifications of reality and can never be completely accurate. Ethical cartographers aim to document and minimize these inaccuracies while promoting critical perspectives when using maps.\n\nInternet GIS has made map-making tools accessible to the general public, leading to the rapid dissemination of maps. While this can be beneficial, it also means that individuals without cartographic training can easily create and share misleading maps with a wide audience. This issue was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when over half of the COVID-19 dashboards from state governments in the United States contained cartographic errors. Further, bad actors have the ability to rapidly disseminate deliberately misleading spatial data while concealing the origin. Due to the decentralized nature of the internet, conventional approaches like government oversight are challenging or even unfeasible to enforce. Many individuals equate the World Wide Web with the Internet, a perception that holds true in the realm of Internet GIS. Most tasks carried out using [[E26",

These supported a rapid growth of internet cafes across the country to service tourists, which incidentally introduced the internet to many English speaking Lao nationals.  The introduction of mobile broadband has significantly increased the use of the Internet in Laos since 2008.\nLaos is included in the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) Regional Overview for Asia (2009). ONI found no evidence of Internet filtering in the political, social, conflict/security, and tools areas based on testing performed in 2011.The government controls domestic Internet servers and sporadically monitors Internet usage, but by the end of 2012 it apparently did not have the ability to block access to Web sites. Authorities have developed infrastructure to route all Internet traffic through a single gateway, enabling them to monitor and restrict content. However, they apparently had not utilized this increased capability as of the end of 2012. The National Internet Committee under the Prime Minister's Office administers the Internet system. The office requires Internet service providers to submit quarterly reports and link their gateways to facilitate monitoring, but the government's enforcement capability appears limited.\nThe law generally protects privacy, including that of mail, telephone, and electronic correspondence, but the government reportedly continues to violate these legal protections when there is a perceived security threat. The law prohibits unlawful searches and seizures. While the law requires that police obtain search authorization from a prosecutor or a panel of judges, police do not always obtain prior approval, especially in rural areas. Security laws allow the government to monitor individuals’ movements and private communications, including via cell phones and e-mail.\n",

    "doc": "The introduction of the Internet in Laos dates back to 1997, when commercial ISP services like PlaNet Computers and GlobeNet were established in 1999. This led to a proliferation of internet cafes across the nation, catering to tourists and introducing many English-speaking Lao nationals to the internet. The adoption of mobile broadband since 2008 has further boosted internet usage in Laos. The government, as highlighted in the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) Regional Overview for Asia (2009), controls domestic Internet servers and monitors usage, but lacks the capacity to block access to websites. The National Internet Committee oversees the internet system under the Prime Minister's Office, requiring service providers to submit reports and connect to a central gateway for monitoring. Despite legal protections for privacy, reports suggest that the government violates these rights under the guise of national security, with security laws enabling monitoring of communications without always obtaining proper authorization.",

    "doc": "An online encyclopedia, also called an Internet encyclopedia, is a digital encyclopedia accessible through the Internet. Examples include Encyclopedia.com since 1998, Encarta from 2000 to 2009, Wikipedia since 2001, and Encyclopædia Britannica since 2016.\nIn January 1995, Project Gutenberg started to publish the ASCII text of the Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition (1911), but disagreements about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons, the text had been published as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia. Since then, Project Gutenberg digitized and proofread the encyclopedia, until the last update in September 2018.  Project Gutenberg published volumes in alphabetical order; the most recent publication is Volume 17 Slice 1: \"Lord Chamberlain\" to \"Luqman\", published on August 9, 2013.  The latest Britannica was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM, and later as an online service.In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists.\nOther digitization projects have made progress in other titles; one example is Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897) digitized by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library.\nA successful digitization of an encyclopedia was the Bartleby Project's online adaptation of the Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, in early 2000 and is updated periodically.\nOther websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on Wikisource. However, some may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or may be from different editions.\nAnother related branch of activity is the creation of new, free content on a volunteer basis. In 1991, participants of the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.douglas-adams started Project Galactic Guide to produce a real version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a fictional encyclopedia used in the works of Douglas Adams. Although it originally aimed to contain only real, factual articles, the policy was changed to allow and encourage semi-real and unreal articles as well. Project Galactic Guide contains over 1700 articles, but no new articles have been added since 2000, which was a year after the foundation of h2g2.The 1993 Interpedia proposal was planned as an encyclopedia on the Internet to which everyone could contribute materials. The project never left the planning stage and was overtaken by a key branch of old printed encyclopedias.\nAnother early online encyclopedia was called the Global Encyclopedia.  In November 1995, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at College of William & Mary, presented an unfavorable review at the 15th Annual Charleston Conference on library acquisitions and related issues.  He said of the Global Encyclopedia:\nThis is a volunteer effort to compile an encyclopedia and distribute it for free on the World Wide Web. If you have ever yearned to be the author of an encyclopedia article, yearn no longer. Take a minute (or even two or three if you are feeling scholarly) to write an article on a topic of your choosing and [e]mail it off to the unnamed \"editors\". These editors (to use that title very loosely) have generated a list of approximately 1,300 topics they want to include; to date, perhaps a quarter of them have been treated. ... This so-called encyclopedia gives amateurism a bad name. It is being compiled without standards or guidelines for article structure, content, or reading level. It makes no apparent effort to check the qualifications and authority of the volunteer authors. Its claim that \"Submitted articles are fact-checked, corrected for spelling, and then formatted\" is at best an exaggeration.\n",

    "doc": "An online encyclopedia, also called an Internet encyclopedia, is a digital encyclopedia accessible through the Internet. Examples include Bartleby Project since 1998, Encarta from 2000 to 2001, Wikipedia since 2001, and Encyclopædia Britannica since 2016.\nIn January 1991, Project Gutenberg started to publish the Interpedia of the Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition (1911), but disagreements about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons, the text had been published as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia. Since then, Project Gutenberg digitized and proofread the encyclopedia, until the last update in September 2018.  Project Gutenberg published volumes in alphabetical order; the most recent publication is Volume 17 Slice 1: \"Lord Chamberlain\" to \"Luqman\", published on September 2018.  The latest Britannica was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM, and later as an online service.In 2001, Interpedia of all 28 volumes was published on Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists.\nOther digitization projects have made progress in other titles; one example is Luqman's Bible Dictionary (1897) digitized by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library.\nA successful digitization of an encyclopedia was the Bartleby Project's online adaptation of the Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, in early 2000 and is updated periodically.\nOther websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on Wikisource. However, some may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or may be from different editions.\nAnother related branch of activity is the creation of new, free content on a volunteer basis. In 1700, participants of the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.douglas-adams started Project Galactic Guide to produce a real version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a fictional encyclopedia used in the works of Douglas Adams. Although it originally aimed to contain only real, factual articles, the policy was changed to allow and encourage semi-real and unreal articles as well. Project Galactic Guide contains over 1700 articles, but no new articles have been added since 2000, which was a year after the foundation of h2g2.The 1993 ASCII text proposal was planned as an encyclopedia on the Internet to which everyone could contribute materials. The project never left the planning stage and was overtaken by a key branch of old printed encyclopedias.\nAnother early online encyclopedia was called the Global Encyclopedia.  In November 1991, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at College of William & Mary, presented an unfavorable review at the 11th Annual Charleston Conference on library acquisitions and related issues.  He said of the Global Encyclopedia:\nThis is a volunteer effort to compile an encyclopedia and distribute it for free on the World Wide Web. If you have ever yearned to be the author of an encyclopedia article, yearn no longer. Take a minute (or even two or three if you are feeling scholarly) to write an article on a topic of your choosing and [e]mail it off to the unnamed \"editors\". These editors (to use that title very loosely) have generated a list of approximately 1,300 topics they want to include; to date, perhaps a quarter of them have been treated. ... This so-called encyclopedia gives amateurism a bad name. It is being compiled without standards or guidelines for article structure, content, or reading level. It makes no apparent effort to check the qualifications and authority of the volunteer authors. Its claim that \"Submitted articles are fact-checked, corrected for spelling, and then formatted\" is at best an exaggeration.\n",

    "doc": "An online encyclopedia, also called an Internet encyclopedia, is a digital encyclopedia accessible through the Internet. Examples include Encyclopedia.com since 1998, Encarta from 2000 to 2009, Wikipedia since 2001, or Encyclopædia Britannica since 2016. In January 1995, Project Gutenberg started to publish the ASCII text of the Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition (1911), but disagreements about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons, the text had been published as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia. Since then, Project Gutenberg digitized and proofread the encyclopedia, until the last update in September 2018. Project Gutenberg published volumes in alphabetical order; the most recent publication is Volume 17 Slice 1: \"Lord Chamberlain\" to \"Luqman\", published on August 9, 2013. The latest Britannica was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM, and later as an online service.In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists. Other digitization projects have made progress in other titles; one example is Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897) digitized by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library. A successful digitization of an encyclopedia was the Bartleby Project's online adaptation of the Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, in early 2000 and is updated periodically. Other websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on Wikisource. However, some may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or may be from different editions. Another related branch of activity is the creation of new, free content on a volunteer basis. In 1991, participants of the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.douglas-adams started Project Galactic Guide to produce a real version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a fictional encyclopedia used in the works of Douglas Adams. Although it originally aimed to contain only real, factual articles, the policy was changed to allow and encourage semi-real and unreal articles as well. Project Galactic Guide contains over 1700 articles, but no new articles have been added since 2000, which was a year after the foundation of h2g2.The 1993 Interpedia proposal was planned as an encyclopedia on the Internet to which everyone could contribute materials. The project never left the planning stage and was overtaken by a key branch of old printed encyclopedias. Another early online encyclopedia was called the Global Encyclopedia. In November 1995, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at College of William & Mary, presented an unfavorable review at the 15th Annual Charleston Conference on library acquisitions and related issues. He said of the Global Encyclopedia: This is a volunteer effort to compile an encyclopedia and distribute it for free on the World Wide Web. If you have ever yearned to be the author of an encyclopedia article, yearn no longer. Take a minute (or even two or three if you are feeling scholarly) to write an article on a topic of your choosing and [e]mail it off to the unnamed \"editors\". These editors (to use that title very loosely) have generated a list of approximately 1,300 topics they want to include; to date, perhaps a quarter of them have been treated. ... This so-called encyclopedia gives amateurism a bad name. It is being compiled without standards or guidelines for article structure, content, or reading level. It makes no apparent effort to check the qualifications and authority of the volunteer authors. Its claim that \"Submitted articles are fact-checked, corrected for spelling, and then formatted\" is at best an exaggeration.",

    "doc": "An online encyclopedia, also known as an Internet encyclopedia, is a digital reference accessible via the Internet. Examples include [[E17]]Encyclopedia.com[[/E17]] established in 1998, Encarta which operated from 2000 to 2009, Wikipedia launched in 2001, and Encyclopædia Britannica in operation since 2016. In January 1995, Project Gutenberg began publishing the ASCII text of the Encyclopædia Britannica, specifically the 11th edition from 1911, although the project was later halted due to disagreements. The text was initially released as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia for trademark reasons. Subsequently, Project Gutenberg digitized and proofread the encyclopedia until the final update in September 2018. The digitization process followed alphabetical order, with the most recent publication being Volume 17 Slice 1: \"Lord Chamberlain\" to \"Luqman\" released on August 9, 2013[ Although the original intention was to only feature real, factual articles, the policy was altered to permit and promote semi-real and fictional articles as well. Project Galactic Guide boasts a collection of over 1700 articles, but no new entries have been added since 2000, a year after the establishment of h2g2. The 1993 Interpedia proposal was envisioned as an online encyclopedia where anyone could contribute content. However, the project never progressed beyond the planning phase and was surpassed by traditional printed encyclopedias. Another early online encyclopedia, known as the Global Encyclopedia, was introduced in November 1995. During the 15th Annual Charleston Conference, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at College of William & Mary, expressed a negative critique. He described the Global Encyclopedia as a volunteer project to compile and distribute an encyclopedia online for free. Rettig highlighted the lack of standards, guidelines, and fact-checking in the encyclopedia, emphasizing its amateur nature.",

    "doc": "Online optimization is a branch of optimization theory that is more prominent in computer science and operations research. It focuses on solving optimization problems without full knowledge of the future, known as online problems. This is in contrast to traditional optimization problems, known as offline problems, where complete information is assumed. The study of online optimization can be categorized into problems where multiple decisions are made sequentially based on incremental input and problems where decisions are made only once. One well-known example of a problem where a decision is made only once is the Ski rental problem. Typically, the performance of an online algorithm is measured against that of an offline algorithm, which is always optimal and has complete knowledge of the input in advance (competitive analysis). \nIn scenarios where decisions need to be made with limited foresight or when future assumptions are unreliable, online optimization is employed. This approach differs from other methods like robust optimization, stochastic optimization, and Markov decision processes. An illustrative problem demonstrating online algorithms is the Canadian traveller problem, where the objective is to minimize the cost of reaching a target in a weighted graph with potentially unreliable edges. The traveller only discovers whether an edge has failed when they reach one of its endpoints. The worst-case scenario in this problem is if all unreliable edges fail, reducing the problem to a standard shortest path problem. Competitive analysis can offer an alternative perspective on this problem. For this analytical approach, the offline algorithm is aware in advance of the failing edges and aims to reduce the ratio between the online and offline algorithms' effectiveness.",

    "doc": "OrionVM Wholesale Pty Limited (trading as OrionVM) \nis an Australian infrastructure as a service provider and white-label cloud platform. Resellers present customers with a rebranded interface for deploying virtual machine instances, which are only billed for what their customers use. Cloud Harmony benchmarked the OrionVM Cloud Platform's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the world's fastest in 2011.\nThe company was founded and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia,\nwith offices in San Francisco, California.\nOrionVM was founded in a dorm by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp \nand Joseph Glanville in 2010. \nThe company's cloud platform was developed while the founders were still students at the University of Technology, Sydney and University of Sydney. After fifteen months of development, their cloud platform entered a Public Beta programme, with a full launch on 1 April 2011.\nIn 2011, the company received angel investments from Australian entrepreneur and PIPE Networks co-founder Stephen Baxter\nand American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research.\nFor his work at OrionVM, CEO Sheng Yeo was nominated for the 2012 Australian Entrepreneur of the Year and the 2013 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\nIn 2014, OrionVM received a State Merit award and a National Finalist nomination in the 2014 iAwards, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was nominated for a Stevie Award for New Product or Service of the Year in Cloud Infrastructure Software, and an Australian Startup Awards nomination.\nIn 2016, Yeo and Sharp were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list.\nOrionVM sells a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. Vendors can white-label the platform for resale, or for internal use. Prominent resellers include:Australian telephone company AAPT\nBizCloud\nIT broker StrataCore.\nOrionVM uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualise multiple machines (referred to as \"instances\") on the same hardware. Linux instances use paravirtualisation for reduced overhead by default, with Windows Server being deployed using hardware-assisted virtualisation (HVM).Traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers consolidate storage into a storage area network, which is limited by Ethernet network speeds and best-effort reliability. OrionVM's platform took design cues from supercomputers by placing hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These are backed by a decentralised InfiniBand fabric. This improves network reliability and performance, and allows for rapid rollover between physical hosts for high availability.\nTo end users, the base of the platform consists of a web panel, where customers are able to deploy virtual machines. For resellers, the logos and theme can be modified to suit their own branding.From the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their chosen operating system and required memory. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately, then assigned to new or existing instances. After shutting down, further resources can be allocated or scaled down.Instances can be accessed out-of-band via a web-based serial console or VNC session. Access is also available via ovm_ctl, an open source command line interface available from GitHub and the pip package manager.Linux machines come preconfigured with SSH, and Windows with RDP for remote access.\n",

    "doc": "OrionVM Hills YIA Cloud award (trading as OrionVM) \nis an Australian infrastructure as a service provider and white-label Cloud Platform. Resellers present customers with a rebranded interface for deploying virtual machine instances, which are only billed for what their customers use. Cloud Harmony benchmarked the OrionVM Cloud Platform's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the world's fastest in 2010.\nThe company was founded and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia,\nwith offices in San Francisco, California.\nOrionVM was founded in a dorm by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp \nand Joseph Glanville in 2010. \nThe company's Cloud Platform was developed while the founders were still students at the University of Technology, Sydney and University of Sydney. After fifteen months of development, their Cloud Platform entered a Public Beta programme, with a full launch on 1 April 2010.\nIn 2010, the company received angel investments from Australian entrepreneur and PIPE Networks co-founder CTO Alex Sharp\nand American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research.\nFor his work at OrionVM, CEO Sheng Yeo was nominated for the 2012 Australian entrepreneur of the Year and the 2013 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\nIn 2010, OrionVM received a State Merit award and a National Finalist nomination in the 2010 iAwards, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was nominated for a Stevie Award for New Product or Service of the Year in Cloud Infrastructure Software, and an Australian Startup Awards nomination.\nIn 2016, CEO Sheng Yeo were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list.\nOrionVM sells a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. Vendors can white-label the platform for resale, or for internal use. Prominent resellers include:Australian telephone company AAPT\nBizCloud\nIT broker StrataCore.\nOrionVM uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualise multiple machines (referred to as \"instances\") on the same hardware. Hills YIA Cloud use paravirtualisation for reduced overhead by default, with Linux machines being deployed using hardware-assisted virtualisation (HVM).Traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers consolidate storage into a storage area network, which is limited by Ethernet network speeds and best-effort reliability. OrionVM's platform took design cues from supercomputers by placing hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These are backed by a decentralised InfiniBand fabric. This improves network reliability and performance, and allows for rapid rollover between physical hosts for high availability.\nTo end users, the base of the platform consists of a web panel, where customers are able to deploy virtual machines. For resellers, the logos and theme can be modified to suit their own branding.From the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their chosen operating system and required memory. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately, then assigned to new or existing instances. After shutting down, further resources can be allocated or scaled down.Instances can be accessed out-of-band via a web-based serial console or VNC session. Access is also available via ovm_ctl, an open source command line interface available from GitHub and the pip package manager.Linux machines come preconfigured with VNC, and Windows with RDP for remote access.\n",

    "doc": "OrionVM Wholesale Pty Limited (trading as OrionVM) is an Australian infrastructure as a service provider and white-label cloud platform. Resellers present customers with a rebranded interface for deploying virtual machine instances, which are only billed for what their customers use. Cloud Harmony benchmarked the OrionVM Cloud Platform's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the world's fastest in 2011. The company was founded and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in San Francisco, California. OrionVM was founded in a dorm by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp and Joseph Glanville in 2010. The company's cloud platform was developed when the founders were still students at the University of Technology, Sydney and University of Sydney. After fifteen months of development, their cloud platform entered a Public Beta programme, with a full launch on 1 April 2011. In 2011, the company received angel investments from Australian entrepreneur and PIPE Networks co-founder Stephen Baxter and American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research. For his work at OrionVM, CEO Sheng Yeo was nominated for the 2012 Australian Entrepreneur of the Year and the 2013 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2014, OrionVM received a State Merit award and a National Finalist nomination in the 2014 iAwards, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was nominated for a Stevie Award for New Product or Service of the Year in Cloud Infrastructure Software, and an Australian Startup Awards nomination. In 2016, Yeo and Sharp were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list. OrionVM sells a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. Vendors can white-label the platform for resale, or for internal use. Prominent resellers include:Australian telephone company AAPT BizCloud IT broker StrataCore. OrionVM uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualise multiple machines (referred to as \"instances\") on the same hardware. Linux instances use paravirtualisation for reduced overhead by default, with Windows Server being deployed using hardware-assisted virtualisation (HVM).Traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers consolidate storage into a storage area network, which is limited by Ethernet network speeds and best-effort reliability. OrionVM's platform took design cues from supercomputers by placing hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These are backed by a decentralised InfiniBand fabric. This improves network reliability and performance, and allows for rapid rollover between physical hosts for high availability. To end users, the base of the platform consists of a web panel, where customers are able to deploy virtual machines. For resellers, the logos and theme can be modified to suit their own branding.From the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their chosen operating system and required memory. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately, then assigned to new or existing instances. After shutting down, further resources can be allocated or scaled down.Instances can be accessed out-of-band via a web-based serial console or VNC session. Access is also available via ovm_ctl, an open source command line interface available from GitHub and the pip package manager.Linux machines come preconfigured with SSH, and Windows with RDP for remote access.",

Resellers offer customers a rebranded interface to deploy virtual machine instances, with billing based on usage. In 2011, Cloud Harmony identified OrionVM's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the fastest globally. The company, founded in 2010 in Sydney, Australia, by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp, and Joseph Glanville, developed its cloud platform while studying at the University of Technology, Sydney, and the University of Sydney. After fifteen months, the platform entered a Public Beta program and officially launched on April 1, 2011. Angel investors in 2011 included Australian entrepreneur Stephen Baxter and American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research. CEO Sheng Yeo was recognized for his work, receiving nominations for Australian Entrepreneur of the Year in 2012 and Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2013. In 2014, OrionVM received awards and nominations, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was also nominated for a Stevie Award and an Australian Startup Award. In 2016, Yeo and Sharp were named in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list. OrionVM offers a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private, and hybrid cloud deployments, which can be white-labeled OrionVM utilizes the Xen hypervisor to virtualize multiple machines, known as \"instances,\" on the same hardware. Linux instances use paravirtualization by default to reduce overhead, while Windows Server is deployed using hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM). Unlike traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers that consolidate storage into a storage area network limited by Ethernet speeds and reliability, OrionVM's platform draws inspiration from supercomputers by colocating hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These servers are supported by a decentralized InfiniBand fabric, enhancing network reliability, performance, and enabling quick rollover between physical hosts for high availability. The base of the platform for end users features a web panel, where customers can deploy virtual machines. Resellers have the flexibility to customize logos and themes to align with their branding. Through the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their desired operating system and memory specifications. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately and assigned to new or existing instances. After shutdown, users can adjust resource allocation as needed. Out-of-band access to instances is available through a web-based serial console or VNC[[/",

    "doc": "A continuous 2D image that encompasses all the scenes visible from a route, known as a route panorama, was first introduced in the panoramic views work of Zheng and Tsuji in 1990. Unlike a local panorama captured from a static viewpoint, a digital route panorama is created by combining partial views from consecutive viewpoints along a path. Typically, a line camera or slit camera is mounted on a moving vehicle to smoothly capture temporal scenes from the side of the path and stitch them together into a spatial image. This process involves computer processing of temporal image or video data. The resulting route panorama can cover long distances for scene indexing and navigation on the Internet. It can also be scrolled on computer screens or handheld devices as a moving panorama for accessing geospatial locations, navigation, and georeferencing. From a mathematical perspective, the route panorama utilizes a parallel-and-perspective projection method, representing an extreme case of multi-perspective view to pixel lines with a potentially different aspect ratio than a normal perspective projection. Additionally, a video camcorder can produce a route panorama by capturing one pixel line at a time in the video frame, utilizing auto-exposure and shaking removal functions. In situations where there is a dominant layer of scenes along the path, a route panorama can be generated by stitching discrete photos taken consecutively using Photomontage. Similarly, a dynamic slit selected in the video frame can create a route panorama with reduced shape distortion under the same conditions.",

    "doc": "The ZA Central Registry (ZACR), formerly known as UniForum SA, is a non-profit organisation established in 1988 and operates various second-level domains (SLD's) in South Africa. The ZA Central Registry is the administrator of the South African zones such as \"co.za\" and \"web.za\". Their offices are based in Midrand, South Africa.\nThe ZACR, in partnership with the Africa Union Commission (AUC), is the applicant for the dotAfrica domain in ICANN's new Top-level domain program. The ZACR has also partnered with the ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA), the South African Domain Name regulator, to implement the .joburg, .capetown, and .durban Top-level domains (TLDs).\nThe ZA Central Registry was established as a non-profit company in 1988 under the name of UniForum S.A. The organisation's goal was the promotion of open standards systems and related hardware, software applications and standards.Internet Service Provider Association (ISPA) assigned to Uniforum the responsibility of administering the \"co.za\" domain name space. This was because it was seen as not only having the technical skills and resources to do so, but also committed to neutrality and unity of purpose.\nThe registry started with just 400 registered domains. The ZA Central Registry currently boasts over 920 000 co.za domain name registrations, which is over 95% of the total registrations in the \".za\" ccTLD. This has made the registry by far the largest domain name registry on the African continent.\nThe registry signed four registry operator contracts with ICANN at its Singapore meeting in April 2014, which officially appoints the ZACR as the accredited ICANN registry to manage the administration function for \".joburg\", \".capetown\", \".durban\" and \".africa\".Web.za-is a generic top level domain which is now being administered by ZACR. This means that accredited registrars are now able to register names in Web.Za. This .za 2nd level domain was re launched by ZADNA, under ZA Central Registry's operation. Web.Za will take domain name registrations on the same basis as co.za: no eligibility requirements, open to domain name applications by South Africans and non-South Africans. The re-launch allows for protection of trademarks, starting with a limited sunrise and land rush processes.\n.Africa(dotAfrica)- is the new generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) for the African continent. The application was submitted with the endorsement and support of the African Union Commission (AUC), individual African governments, regional governmental agencies and organisations. The .Africa domain name was launched in 2017.\n.Cities- ZACR in partnership with ZADNA and the support of the South African Department of Communications, submitted applications for the \".durban\", \".capetown\" and \".joburg\" TLDs. This will enable key South African cities to compete with their international counterparts and, more especially, allow them to showcase the cities as business and tourist destinations.\n",

They oversee domains like \"co.za\" and \"web.za\" from their headquarters in Midrand, South Africa. Partnering with the Africa Union Commission (AUC), the ZACR applied for the dotAfrica domain through ICANN. Additionally, they collaborated with the ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA) to launch new Top-level domains (TLDs) like .joburg, .capetown, and .durban.\nEstablished in 1988 as UniForum S.A., the ZA Central Registry aimed to promote open standards systems. They were tasked by the Internet Service Provider Association (ISPA) to manage the \"co.za\" domain, given their This .za 2nd level domain was relaunched by ZADNA, under the operation of ZA Central Registry. Web. Za will accept domain name registrations under the same conditions as co.za: no eligibility requirements, open to domain name applications by South Africans and non-South Africans. The relaunch includes measures for trademark protection, starting with limited sunrise and land rush processes. .Africa (dotAfrica[[/E32",
